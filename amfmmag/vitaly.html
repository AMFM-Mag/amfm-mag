      <p dir="ltr">Sometimes the best ideas are born when you least expect it. At least that&rsquo;s what happened for Shane Vitaly Foran when he went backpacking in Bali. Soul searching, surfing and seeking sanity, he found inspiration in the local artisanal jewelry markets of Bali and the hand crafted expertise of the skilled craftsmen. Foran sought for a way to connect the expertise and style of the jewelry he was seeing with the modernity of the street culture and fashion from his home and the likes of his friends. </p>
      A spark was ignited and with the help of the Indonesian local jewelers his idea was given vitality, and thus Vitaly, the Toronto based jewelry design company was born. He joined forces with his longtime friend Jason Readman, who also believed in his vision. The first concepts were widely well received within social media, and the two became a sensation rather quickly. The jewelry is edgy, rustic, and a bit rough around the edges, yet somehow sleek. Simple, but intricate, the bracelets, pendants and chains are like woven industrial ropes, made from stainless steel chain mail and leather. The rings can pack a punch, single, double, or triple, and most pieces come with back story about the materials and their origins.
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">amfm: </strong>What is the significance of the name Vitaly for you? Why did you choose to call your line this?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">vitaly: </strong>For me, I&rsquo;ve always pulled my focus to the root of the word which is &lsquo;Vita&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;life.&rsquo; Vitaly was also my last name at birth, but changed years later. I always felt connected to the name though, and when I decided to start a lifestyle jewelry brand, it was just the most obvious choice. Today though, when I think of the word Vitaly, I think freedom.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">amfm: </strong>Vitaly was born in Bali where you were inspired by the hand crafted jewelry being produced there. What were you doing in Bali to begin with and how did that trip evolve into leaving with a mission? And what about the jewelry inspired you to pursue your own?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">vitaly: </strong>I landed in Bali on a three month backpacking trip that I took after graduating from University. I&rsquo;d been in school full-time and was balancing three jobs at the same time, with only four hours of sleep at best every night for two years. I was burnt out and needed to pick up and make a quick change to save my sanity. I ended up going to Bali towards the end of my trip to learn to surf and ended up finding myself drawn to the inland beauty and culture. That was when I started to come across more and more incredible artisans and found myself inspired. It wasn't any one style or piece of jewelry that inspired me, but rather a combination of their skills and my desire to juxtapose their craft with more of a street style. After having something made for myself I asked my friends if they&rsquo;d like anything and their response was shocking. Ultimately, their response was likely the catalyst that put Vitaly&rsquo;s wheels into motion.</p>
<strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">amfm: </strong>Where does your inspiration come from? What does the idea to design process look like?
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">vitaly: </strong>The majority of my inspiration comes from what I feel like wearing or what I think my friends would like. I then typically draw the inspiration for the details from architecture. </p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">amfm: </strong>You say you design with your friends in mind, and that they are one of your biggest influences. What kind of company do you keep? How do your friends influence your work for Vitaly? </p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">vitaly: </strong>I keep great company. My friends are inspiring, hard working, generous and fair people. I like spending my time around open-minded people who want to get as much out of this world and life as they can. Being that my friends are very open-minded people, they also tend to be quite eclectic and have a range of styles, and that tends to lend to a lot of different inspiration. </p>
<p> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">amfm: </strong>You kind of got a following quite rapidly, and went from a jewelry post to big brand recognition. Had you always wanted to have your own line? What do you think it is about Vitaly and your jewelry that caught people's eye and sets you apart?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">vitaly:</strong> I&rsquo;m extremely grateful for how quickly our following has grown. I can&rsquo;t really say for certain what it was that caught people&rsquo;s eye, but I like to think that it&rsquo;s a combination of things. We&rsquo;re very determined to project the lifestyle we stand for, and I think a lot of people can relate to that. I also think that the quality of our products for the price-point and the fact that we&rsquo;re not afraid to keep our designs simple has really impacted people&rsquo;s loyalty to the brand. </p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-5ca0819b-0c2f-dd88-5401-28b1a7997dd">amfm: </strong>What accessory can you not live without. Ring, necklace or bracelet?</p>
<p><strong>vitaly: </strong>At the moment, I can&rsquo;t leave the house without wearing at least a couple of bracelets. I definitely go through phases though. I went about three years straight with a two finger ring on. These days I tend to wear rings on nearly every finger as well.</p>
