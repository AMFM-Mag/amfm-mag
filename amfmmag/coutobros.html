      <p dir="ltr"><strong>The Couto Bros.</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The Couto Brothers came out of the womb with paintbrushes in hand and thus began leaving their paint strokes on the canvas of life. After all, they do attest to having been making art since they were born. A figurative statement, but a true reality, these two brothers have been making art together for as a long as they can remember. Their pieces are usually large scale kaleidoscopes, and vibrant collages of color and pattern. </p>
      Currently stationed out in LA, these brothers are quite the worldly pair. They were raised in Brazil, and have lived all over the world. They say their biggest inspiration is the five continents that lie before them. Whether it be in the form of a mural, a sticker, a video, or the pieces they have sold privately or shown publicly, they have been leaving their mark wherever they go and have left a colorful trail behind them. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">amfm: </strong>How much of your work is actually done together? What does that process look like for you and what is your dynamic while making art? Is there ever like brother stuff that gets in the way?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">the couto bros: </strong>We do everything together from beginning to end. From concepting an idea, to an image, to building a frame, to the actual painting. Of course we have different strengths and weaknesses, we take this into full consideration and apply ourselves accordingly. We just have fun when we think of an idea and we get really excited about it. &nbsp;If we're excited about it, then there must be others out there that would be just as excited as we are. When we paint, we just go to town. Music and friends are always around when we do so. As for brothers doing things together, what do you think? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">amfm: </strong>How did you guys get into making art? What was your childhood like in relation to art? Did you guys grow up creating things, or surrounded by art and artful things?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">couto: </strong>We started doing art individually since the day we were born. We inspired each other constantly during our childhood. &nbsp;Our mother was also a main source to the world of art, music and dance. Growing up she would take us to the ballet, to museums, even to the opera. Constantly surrounding us with the arts. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">amfm: </strong>You guys are quite the world travelers, how do your travels influence your work or the concepts behind your work? What has been your favorite place to visit that has inspired your artwork the most?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">couto: </strong>Growing up, we traveled and moved around a lot. This of course influences our art and what we give back to the world. We like to think that our work is the culmination and reflection of these travels. Our favorite place that we've traveled to is very hard to pinpoint, there's just so many, but if we had to choose one country to be the most influential on us, it would probably have to be Brazil. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">amfm: </strong>What kind of commentary are you attempting to make with your work using historical figures, pop culture icons and symbols? How does your signature style of patterns and color allude to that or transform your pieces? What kind of social topics are you guys most drawn to making a commentary about through your art?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">couto: </strong>We have many different statements, themes and missions surrounding our art. We think one of our main ideas behind our work is to invite the viewer to look at something from a non-judgmental point of view. We accomplish this by bringing up topics that many don't really want to discuss or even think about. Our colors and shapes make it beautiful, even when we are touching on darker topics. Of course all this color is loud, and our art is loud. Sometimes it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s needed to get someone's attention. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">amfm:</strong> You guys have been leaving your mark in a lot of places, and moving about from place to place. What do you hope to be known for art wise? What's next for you guys?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9d062ee4-cc4c-9080-ff65-adf433dca9c5">couto: </strong>We are constantly trying to create and do bigger. Murals for us can be grandiose and impactful without a doubt, but we want to go bigger than that. &nbsp;We just want to be known as the ones who brought color back to the world. &nbsp;As for what&rsquo;s next, we ourselves don't know, all we know is that we're ready. <br />
