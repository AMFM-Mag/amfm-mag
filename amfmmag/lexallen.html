      <p><strong>Lex Allen</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Back in February, Milwaukee hosted its first annual Arte Para Todos (&ldquo;Art For Everyone&rdquo;) Festival to raise money for arts programming at three Milwaukee-area schools. One of those recipients was Bay View High School, Lex Allen&rsquo;s alma mater. Did you know that &ldquo;alma mater&rdquo; translates from Latin to &ldquo;nourishing mother&rdquo;? Well, Lex has his fair share of nourishing mothers, starting with a strong biological goddess. His soulful pop music is infused with the wisdom of his elders and spiked with the energy of his peers.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">      Arte Para Todos was a special weekend because in one day you could experience two different versions of Lex&rsquo;s hit song, &ldquo;Puppy Love.&rdquo; Early Saturday night he played a stripped down acoustic set at Linneman&rsquo;s Riverwest Inn, which had me reminiscing over Flaming Hot-stained hands being held in my high school hallway. Later that night, alongside his New Age Narcissism family (a collective of like-minded musicians based in Milwaukee that includes Webster X, Lorde Fredd33, Siren, Q. The Sun and BMad Boss), &ldquo;Puppy Love&rdquo; rocked Mad Planet with heavy drums and roaring guitars, which conjured more illicit thoughts. Whether he&rsquo;s singing about cancer, capitalism or voguing in your underwear, Lex Allen&rsquo;s music will stir your emotions and shake your spirit. <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm: </strong>Rightfully, you don&rsquo;t like to pigeonhole your sound. You certainly have a diversity of influences. So I&rsquo;m wondering, if you could have a dinner party with any musicians, living or dead, who would you invite?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex allen:</strong> If I could have a dinner party, a &ldquo;Red Is The Color Of Passion&quot; themed dinner party, this would be the list: Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, Lauryn Hill, Pavarotti, Adele, Michael Jackson and Beyonce. We would just sit and harmonize all night underneath the stars, real camp circle like. Picture it, somewhere in Sicily, 2015. Lauryn and Amy hit Lex with a beautiful harmony. Beyoncé intercepts us with the high note from halo, Pavarotti takes the low note, then Adele sets fire to the rain. Michael Jackson hits Whitney with a &ldquo;Hee-Hee&rdquo; and Whitney starts singing &ldquo;I Will Always Love You.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m at the head of the table with a perma-smile on my face, living for it all. Sounds like a dinner no one would want to leave, right?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm: </strong>Milwaukee Pride is coming up this weekend. It will be your second outing on that stage. What was the experience like playing your hometown Pride the first time? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex: </strong>Pride Fest is one of the biggest events for the LGBTQ community. It is a very freeing experience. Having the ability to walk around and be comfortable in your own skin, that&rsquo;s one of the best feelings. The first time I performed at Pride it was amazing. I was sowing my Southern colonel cowboy oats that night, which you&rsquo;re bound to do when rocking those boots. The crowd was so receptive to what the band and I were doing and they got pretty crazy when we brought out the burlesque beauty Zara Estelle during 'Near You.'<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm: </strong>Have you been to Pride in other cities? If so, what are some of your fondest memories?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex: </strong>Outside of Milwaukee, I&rsquo;ve celebrated Pride in Chicago and Minneapolis. If I had to choose one of my best memories from Chicago, I'd have to remember it first. &nbsp;Minneapolis Pride, same story. My friends and I get a little wild, but it&rsquo;s okay because I always feel safe with them. They know when it&rsquo;s time for me to go to bed. Any friend who knows that is true to you! Even if they draw things that will not be mentioned, on your face.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm: </strong>Lex Allen is a force unto himself, but what has it meant for you to link up with the New Age Narcissism (NAN) movement?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex: </strong>Becoming part of the NAN movement has meant freedom from my own self doubt. The brethren Webster X, Lorde Fredd33, Q. The Sun, and BMad Boss remind me to simply be myself every moment of the day. It really is all about who you associate with. My mom taught me that at an early age. &quot;Be around people who move you.&quot; She&rsquo;s a very wise woman.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm: </strong>I was lucky enough to sit in at a NAN practice last month where you debuted a new song entitled &ldquo;Taps for Likes.&rdquo; What is your opinion of our hyper-connected society?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex:</strong> In my opinion, technology is a double edged sword that we live and die by. The Internet is a place where we can explore and discover. It is also a haven for hate. Find your techno balance, see what works for you. &quot;Taps For Likes&quot; expresses how I feel about all of that. You'll be able to listen to that track sooner than you think.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm:</strong> In addition to being a singer extraordinaire, you&rsquo;re a photographer as well. In your mind, what makes for an ideal photo shoot?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex: </strong>In my mind&rsquo;s eye, the ideal photo would be a naturally lit composition. I love natural light, the way it falls on the skin, or any object for that matter. Sunlight enhances an image so much, as if it were touched by her majesty in the stars herself.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">amfm: </strong>Tell our dear readers about your first puppy love?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0de90c87-b83f-031e-7b53-6baf6a411f4e">lex: </strong>My first Puppy Love was to a Denise G. She had the voice of an angel. I remember walking her home from the school bus, eating dinner at her moms, and harmonizing with her to Beyoncé songs. She is now married to her lovely wife and I'm performing at Pride. Life is funny. I live and love it all.</p>
