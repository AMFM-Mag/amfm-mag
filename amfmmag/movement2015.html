    A Movement Memorial Day</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">There&rsquo;s a reason we keep coming back to Detroit for Movement, and why the festival has been growing and going strong for 16 years. The festival is held annually over the Memorial Day weekend in the heart of Detroit, Hart Plaza. Known for its roots in Motown and Electronic music, Detroit is far from just musically inclined, it&rsquo;s musically designed like the automobiles that the city is known for. The festival itself brings out hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world to the Motor City, and a city that often gets a bad rep for its downfall. We&rsquo;ve said it before, and we&rsquo;ll say it again, Detroit is not dead. Festivals like this one are very much a part of its long lasting vitality. </p>      This year was bigger and better than ever. Over the course of the weekend there were some amazing sets from Disclosure, Shigeto, Boys Noize featuring Skrillex, Squarepusher, The Saunderson Brothers, Carl Craig, and hip hoppers turned electronic for the weekend, Method Man, Danny Brown and Snoop Dogg. The festival grounds weren&rsquo;t the only thing worth making the trek out to Detroit for, but the after parties gave a more intimate opportunity to party til the wee hours of the morning.<br />
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">There is no better way to spend your Memorial Day than dancing and basking in the sun surrounded by music, dancing and an eclectic group of people. Miss your hot dogs and burgers? One of the bars down the street has got you covered. The whole downtown makes way for Movement and it turns into one huge party.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">      <strong>Here are some of the many reasons we keep coming back to Movement: </strong><br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>5. &nbsp;Chillspace and Art </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/chillspace.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="chillspace" /></p>
      Aside from simply being a music festival, Movement is an experience, and part of that experience is the art and the setup. From hammocks hanging from trees, to painted pallets turned to chairs, and a chalk wall this festival is set up to be as visually stimulating as audibly. They always enlist local artists to showcase their work, and there is always plenty of seating for when your feet grow too weary from dancing. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>4. Underground Dance Parties</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong><img src="../images/amfmmag/underground.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="underground" /></strong></p>      If you aren&rsquo;t too afraid to venture to the Underground Stage, you will find the closest thing to an all day rave. Dark, seedy, sweaty, and smoky, this underground party isn&rsquo;t for the light festival goer. You might feel like you need more drugs, or the music might make you feel like you are already. Nina Kraviz and Snoopadelic were some of the lighter music sets, but if you&rsquo;re looking for some deep bass techno, trance, furries and a little darkness, head underground. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>3. Cool Parents &amp; Free People </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/coolparents.jpg" alt="coolparents" width="525" height="250" /></p>      You might be thinking, why on earth would someone bring their kids to this? Why on earth not! Movement is for everyone. There&rsquo;s a certain free spirit that comes with the festival, and why wouldn&rsquo;t you want to expose your children to that? There are people dancing everywhere, feeling the rhythm in their bodies, a sense of community, and individualism in the air. Folks come out in many different expressions, colors of hair, costumes, some dressed up as stuffed animals, and what kid wouldn&rsquo;t love that? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>2. Dope DJs </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong><img src="../images/amfmmag/dopedjs.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="dopedjs" /></strong></p>      This festival&rsquo;s music selection just keeps getting better and better. There is a healthy balance between big names, local acts and DJs on the rise. The festival has also been bringing in some more mainstream acts, which of course has stirred up a bit of controversy, but is to be expected when a festival reaches new heights. Movement is the opportunity to see some of the DJ&rsquo;s who helped birth and continue the electronic movement, and repeated favorites like Kevin Saunderson, The Saunderson Brothers, The Martinez Brothers, Nick Speed, and Carl Craig. The sixth stage, which is a lovely addition, hosts local lesser known DJs and gives them the limelight to rock the stage. The festival wouldn&rsquo;t be right if they didn&rsquo;t include a plethora of local big names like The Detroit Techno Militia who collectively included some of the city&rsquo;s biggest names. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Detroit: The City Itself</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/welcometodetroit.jpg" alt="detroit" width="525" height="250" /></p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">There&rsquo;s a certain beauty to the city, whether it be the musical roots, the art and graffiti that&rsquo;s strewn across the walls, the pianos placed in random places downtown, the makeshift art gardens, the lake, the buildings, and even the abandon of the burned houses and structures. There are so many people there who believe in Detroit and want to see it thrive. Forget whatever you heard about Detroit, your preconceived notions, your jokes, your ignorance. Go there. Detroit could be any of us. Beautiful, broken, struggling, rising, and strong.</p>
