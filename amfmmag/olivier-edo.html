/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

    <p> Olivier Jean-Daniel Souffrant is a portrait of an artist as a young man. If you were to pluck Olivier from modern times and send him back in time to 1920&rsquo;s Harlem, he would fit right in. Surely his work is inspired by Basquiat, but not in the way most people would think. The homage to Basquiat is not an allusion, but an honest snapshot of the inner workings of his mind translated on the canvas, whether it be it a fleeting thought, a word, color block, or a sketch or doodle. There&rsquo;s a certain raw element in his approach to his work that you can see in his stroke and in the way that he interacts with the canvas. It&rsquo;s finished, yet a work in progress. It&rsquo;s what happens when minimalism meets collage, and when an old soul lives in modern times. </p>

Early on, I got inspired by him and started copying the things he would draw. Coming home from work, my mom would also bring me Disney coloring books, paper and crayons. I didn&rsquo;t really take art seriously at first, but when I understood its importance, and how it can significantly impact the way we understand things in our society, I took it seriously.</p><p><img src="../images/amfmmag/olivier2.jpg" width="700" height="400" alt="calid b" /></p>

I try to incorporate those as much as possible in my paintings and drawings. I ultimately want to leave a body of work that is appreciated in our contemporary time, but also a body of work that the next generations will be able to look at and feel a certain level of connection to. </p>
