      <p><strong>Sylvan Esso: Metro Chicago </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath, the duo that makes up the electro folk duo, Sylvan Esso, have a certain cosmic connection, and there was something magical about their performance at Metro Chicago this Saturday.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">      Categorizing them to simply electro-folk, is an understatement. Throw in a little pop, hip-hop sprinkled with a lil r&amp;b and you might graze the surface. The two of them both coming from folk backgrounds took on the side project as somewhat of a refresher. The energy these two exude on stage is electric, bouncing off of each other, the music, the lights, tour intensity and the momentum of the audience. They played to a sold out crowd, on their third day of their first tour. Not bad for a band that wasn&rsquo;t intended, but was definitely meant to be. &nbsp; <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Meath is a powerhouse on the mic, same with Sanborn on the synthesizer, dripping in bass. She never stopped moving, and was completely animated in all of her movements despite wearing two inch platform sneakers; she constantly wooed the audience with her puppetry. Before professing their love of Chicago, and how &ldquo;nice&rdquo; we were, considering the zombie apocalypse that was St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day weekend in Wrigleyville just outside, they had the crowd from the first song, &ldquo;Could I Be.&rdquo; Hell, they had the crowd as soon as Flock of Dimes - a one woman band, their opener, a more subdued form of electronically influenced folk came out. She warmed up the crowd quite nicely, and her shy humor and humble nature was well received.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> The show never waned in energy, each song building off of one another. Meath went into a verse of &ldquo;Flawless&rdquo; by Beyonce repeating &ldquo;I woke up like this,&rdquo; as the outro to their third song, &ldquo;Dress,&rdquo; before going into one of their biggest hits, &ldquo;Coffee,&rdquo; which resulted in a beautiful sing along and acoustic moment in their set when just about every person in the crowd sang back &ldquo;do you love me?&rdquo; after Meath crooned &ldquo;baby&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; and the catchy hook &ldquo;my baby does the hanky panky.&rdquo; <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Their lyrics and their vibe take you back to happier childlike times, and inner animal instincts with a bit of howling at the moon for &ldquo;Wolf.&rdquo; One of my favorites of the night was &ldquo;H.S.K.T,&rdquo; which stands for Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, which is kind of like the 80&rsquo;s and pop art meets dubstep sing-a-long. They also performed a new song, &ldquo;Dance,&rdquo; a poppy &ldquo;plinko&rdquo; like sound infused with heavy synth. A new song is an indication that there definitely is new stuff to come from the duo. With a slow build up before Nick dropped the beat, &ldquo;Hey Mami&rdquo; was one of the crowd favorites, along with &ldquo;Play It Right,&rdquo; the last song before their encore. </p>      After such a high energy show, all the serotonin seeping from the audience&rsquo;s skin, they made sure the come down was a pleasant one. They slowed things down to end the night with a beautiful extended rendition of &ldquo;Come Down.&rdquo; The lights were dimmed with a cool blue hue, and there was something about the way light was reflected that gave it a smoky airy feel, as Amelia sang the breathy vocals. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Their family members who happened to be in the balcony looking on appeared proud and in awe, as they should be. I&rsquo;ll take my coffee with a side of Sylvan Esso any day.</p>
