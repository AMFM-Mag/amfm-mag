      <p><strong>Benjamin Booker: Metro Chicago</strong><br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">Benjamin Booker may look like the boy next door, he came out onto stage beer in hand, wearing black jeans, a long sleeve shirt and a green Cubs baseball hat, but he most definitely is not. The young rising star from New Orleans played at the legendary Metro Chicago last night to a sold out crowd. A feat he said he will cross off his bucket list, after noting that Nirvana played on the same stage. Opening for him was Nashville rocker chick, Olivia Jean, who was formerly in the band The Black Belles, an all female band with a garage punk feel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Booker came right out to a backdrop of old jazzy underground club speakeasy music, guitar ablazing, and went through at least four songs before addressing the audience. From the moment he began singing his first few songs, &ldquo;Always&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chippewa,&rdquo; his raspy voice, quick finger work and high energy kept the crowd live. The entire audience was hooting and hollering, hands in the air, and tapping their feet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Booker himself appeared to be in transcendental state while he was playing his music, eyes closed, and body jerking. His raspy voice belting out his bluesy New Orleans rock. He&rsquo;s younger gritty Jimi Hendrix type with a bluegrass flair and old soul. He slowed things down by the fourth song to catch his breath and take a sip of beer on one of his more sentimental, popular songs of the evening &ldquo;Happy Homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Booker, sure knew how to bring the southern charm with with a bit of grit. When he addressed the crowd he said how good it is to be in Chicago, and how rowdy people always get. He asked them to turn up the lights so he could see everyone&rsquo;s faces, and even brought a few people up on the stage to dance while he played. He got the audience involved, asking them to sing along in his rendition of old 1910&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Little Liza Jane,&rdquo; a standard brass band traditional favorite from his hometown, before going into &ldquo;Shout Bamalama,&rdquo; an Otis Redding cover. </p>
<p>He switched guitars throughout his set, and was clearly in tune with the drummer, Max Norton. He was also accompanied by a fiddle and bassist. Booker definitely has some chops, and at the ripe age of 25 he released his debut self titled album and is definitely growing into his artistry. But he is still rebellious enough to light a cigarette in the theater while performing his song &ldquo;H.Y.S.M.S.&rdquo; &nbsp;The song had a dark smoky feel, and that wasn&rsquo;t just from the cigarette. Before getting into his last song, he thanked the audience and said that this would definitely be their last song, &ldquo;none of that fake encore shit,&rdquo; and went into &ldquo;By The Evening,&rdquo; a slow lulling lullaby with a scratchy edge from the slide of his guitar and the lilt of his voice. &ldquo;I will be long gone,&rdquo; he crooned, bidding us farewell.&nbsp;</p>
