/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

    <h2>IN MUSIC: CALID B</h2>
Calid B is what you would call a triple threat in the creative sphere. He's a musician, a fire producer, and is the founder of his own clothing brand called Ochio, a combination of his Ohio roots, and his current home in Chicago. His roots don't just lie there, Calid orignally hails from Cote D'Ivoire, and his African roots are most prevalent in his most recent EP, <em>Afrobang</em>.<br />

    <h2>IN FASHION: INARU </h2>
INARU <em>(pronounced e-na-ru) </em>is what happens when art, jewelry and spirit and nature collide. Jecilia Negron, the artist and mastermind behind the jewelry line decided to adorn bodies with art rather than on the canvases she was used to working with. Negron, who comes from a family of artists and musicians, is a painter and photographer, and recently launched INARU.
