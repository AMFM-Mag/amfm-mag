      <p><strong>The House Show</strong><br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">The House Show is a musical experience unlike any other. I received an email with an undisclosed location, and approached an ambiguous building in a semi-residential neighborhood in Chicago. Sounds kind of like the beginning of a horror movie, but what I found was more like an independent art film. I was literally walking into someone&rsquo;s loft. Will Post greeted me at the door, I hung my jacket in the hallway closet, and he announced to the sold out crowd of about 40-50, very well dressed, and eccentric people, &ldquo;welcome to my house.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House Show is like a house party with sophisticated music performances, free food and flowing drinks. This wasn&rsquo;t like your average high school house party where your friend&rsquo;s garage band was the entertainment for the evening. This was much much more. I felt right at home. There were vats of chili to go around with all the fixings, made by local chef Ryan Silver, a counter stocked with bottles of red wine, beer, and liquor, couches, and art prints to be sold. </p>
<p>The series that has happened every month since October, has come very far from their humble beginnings playing for an audience of about ten on a rainy day to a sold out home. It came complete with visuals projected on the wall, lights, and elaborate showcasing of the projections. Most of the musicians on the bill this night were old roommates, and helped to create the series; however, each month features different artists, a changing menu and vibe. <br />
</p>
<p>The music bill consisted of the soulful rocking of Julian Bell who proved he has master chops on the guitar, even so much as doing a rendition of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thriller,&rdquo; and testing out all new songs for the crowd. Elijiah Noll delivered a bellowing set on a synthesizer and violin, a mix between trip hop classical indie meets the mellow tone of Citizen Cope. Andrew Lothrian, most comparable to the tears you would shed listening to a Bon Iver song, proved to be a great comedian with his witty sarcasm and a truly moving musician on acoustic guitar set to the backdrop of his step-godfather&rsquo;s art. <br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">Closing the night was the most elaborate and anticipated of the show, an electronic phantom of the opera style closing from Will Post who opened the night with a cover of Kanye West&rsquo;s &ldquo;Coldest Winter,&rdquo; and later emerged donning a silver face mask in front of 10 projection screens that really made you feel like you were set in the scene of an opera. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
I left feeling warmer than I had come on that cold bitter Chicago &ldquo;spring&rdquo; night with a flurry of emotions brought on by the music. Aside from it being a music show, it was genuinely like a house party, with kitchen conversations and bathroom waiting lines included. A perfect fusion. I was glad to have been invited to their lovely abode, and hope to be welcomed again.<br />
