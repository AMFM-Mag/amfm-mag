      <p><strong>Angel Haze || Subterranean Chicago</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Haze came to Subterranean in Chicago this November as a part of their <em>Back to the Woods</em> World Tour. Haze may be known for their sharp and ruthless tongue, but there is more to them than their love of tits, even though there were plenty of them despite it being an all ages show. Haze is a powerhouse when it comes to stage presence and energy, and their lyrical chops do not disappoint, after all they are a huge fan of the esoteric dark nature of Edgar Allen Poe. </p>
      <h6><img src="../images/amfmmag/devmo.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="devmo" /><br />
        <em>Dev Mo </em></h6>
      <p dir="ltr">Opening the show was Los Angeles&rsquo; Dev Mo, who upon first glance appeared to be a demure blond princess type, yet when she opened her mouth there was a fluidity and bite to her flow, and this wasn&rsquo;t your Iggy Azelea type at all. There was substance to her music, aside from cannabis related content, she rapped about dream chasing with much heart. She definitely had the crowd hype, bringing multiple acts on stage to join her for her set including Chicago songstress, Joslyn Singer, whose voice boomed through the crowd. </p>
      <h6 dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/devmo2.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="DEVMO" /><br />
      <em>Dev Mo and Joslyn Singer</em></h6>
      <p dir="ltr">A-Cross followed with hard hitting conscious bars. It wasn&rsquo;t too preachy, but a return to the real roots of hip hop. He rapped about not wanting to be signed to a label, which was quite fitting for a Haze show who went head to head with label giants over her integrity, something which Cross is definitely full of. It was refreshing to hear music with a meaning.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Then like a wolf emerging from the bushes, Haze came down the spiral staircase to a fired up crowd. They immediately lit up a blunt on stage, and dived right into their set. The show was full of howling and fanfare, but only in that cheeky off the cuff way that a person as good looking and with such a following like Haze could do. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/angelhaze2.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="ANGEL" /></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Several fans were brought on stage to be serenaded, bringing some girls to tears and shaking in adoration, not to mention all the googly eyes from the audience. Mid song Haze got distracted and stopped the show for an impromptu titty signing session. The show was turnt with crowd jumping, Haze even getting in on all of the action positioning themselves in the middle of the audience moshing with their fans and taking pictures. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you as much energy as you give me,&rdquo; they said, and the audience brought on the energy for sure. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/angelhaze3.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="ANGEL" /></p>
      <p>Aside from a big voice, Haze definitely has heart. There is something quite profound about their story and their words of wisdom about life only someone who has risen from the ashes, through the haze, and the back of the woods can spout in such an elegant way. </p>
