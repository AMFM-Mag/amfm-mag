      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Rollie </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">If you take a walk in designer, Jean Vincent Lebon&rsquo;s shoes, you will have stepped foot into greatness. There&rsquo;s a reason they say that life's a journey, and all those steps led him to create Rollie, a vibrant, lightweight edgy shoe brand based in Melbourne, Australia. With a rainbow of colors, and a kaleidoscope of styles and patterns, these shoes pack a heavy punch when they meet the eye; however, when it comes to the foot it&rsquo;s like walking on air - they are no heavier than your average banana.<br />
        <br />
      Equally as practical as they are fashionable, Rollie offers a wide range of variety, from art inspired palettes in oxford styles, polka dots, crocodile textures, intricate design inspired cutouts, to the classic chelsea and lug boot, and popular slip ons. Light enough to add to your luggage, and add a little spring to your step, these shoes are taking over nation's, hearts, and soles, one step at a time.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">amfm: </strong>You were making shoes before Rollie and involved in the shoe business and fashion, what prompted you to take the leap and launch Rollie? You said being self employed brought Rollie to fruition. Why did you want to become self employed and take on that endeavor in the first place?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">rollie: </strong>I just felt like after 10 years in the business it was time, and I felt that I really had a lot to offer the industry. I also wanted to challenge myself and I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit. I wanted to be self employed so I could have creative control and one day financial freedom<strong>. </strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">amfm:</strong> You learned your craft designing shoes by shadowing and working for a shoe wholesaler, how did that experience prepare you for running your own shoe line? What was the greatest thing you learned then before kicking off Rollie and how did that help develop you as a person and your work?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">rollie: </strong>Shadowing a director for five years for a leading independent wholesaler showed me how to build my own line and taught me what to do and more importantly what not to do through the experience. The greatest thing I learnt was to value the people you work with, to try and put yourself in other people&rsquo;s shoes (pun intended) and obviously international trade. Working under a successful brand prior also gave me the confidence to launch my own brand with the goal of also being successful. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">amfm: </strong>You said you love how technical footwear is and that aspect of it is what drives you. What about that inspires or moves you? What else do you love about shoes?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">rollie: </strong>People, travel, music and food is what inspires me in footwear and in life in general. I love the emotional connection that our shoes create with our customers. It&rsquo;s fashion, function and art all in one. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">amfm: </strong>The shoes have a very playful, and colorful vibrant aesthetic to them, not to mention how light they are. How do the shoes you design reflect who you are as a designer and person and how you live your life?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">rollie:</strong> Ironically, I wear black and grey on a daily basis; however, I like to think that I have a very fun and light hearted approach to life. I also like to think I am caring person about other people, as the brand was created for the people and the shoes were named after my wife. I wanted to build a sense of community hence the brand name, Rollie Nation. I wanted people to feel a sense of belonging with our brand.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">amfm: </strong>Rollie was named after your wife's nickname and her experience as a flight attendant, do you think if you hadn't have met your wife Rollie or some form of Rollie would exist?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">rollie:</strong> It definitely would have been different, in terms of the name and the concept would be different, but I think the core of the brand would be the same, built on innovation and an emotional connection with customers. The cool quirky aesthetic is an outcome of the way I connect with life. 
<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">amfm: </strong>Why do you feel that shoes are and will always be a commodity?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-be4e4c91-69f0-ab0c-2d06-e0fe162d86de">rollie: </strong>Purely due to its function and form. It's practical, and it&rsquo;s a necessity. It's some form of foot closure and the fact that you can feel good when you're wearing cool, fun and quirky shoes is a bonus.<br />
