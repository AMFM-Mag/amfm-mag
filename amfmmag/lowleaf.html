      <p><strong>Low Leaf</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Listening to the Filipino songstress and harpist Low Leaf out of Los Angeles is like having a spiritual experience. For her music is like meditation, and you can definitely see that influence in her music which can send you into trance. Each note she plays is a piece of her. It&rsquo;s not often that the harp, hip hop, soul and electronic fall into the same category. Low Leaf, who writes, mixes, produces and plays a number of instruments is able to meld together many different sounds and influences and break the boundaries of genre. </p>      After releasing a number of LPs, her most recent album AKASHAALAY is her first record label release off of Fresh Selects. Songs like &ldquo;Set Me Free,&rdquo; which comes in with some nice piano chops that tips the hat to old school blues with a modern energy, and &ldquo;Rise Up,&rdquo; which shows off her skills in mixing and production, are two stand out tracks. The album is an homage to her Filipino heritage following a trip to get more in touch with her roots. Listening to it is like going on a journey through a pilgrimage of the soul of Low Leaf. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">amfm: </strong>You play a number of instruments and make your own beats and speak about music as thing that sort of compels you and your spirit. What was one of your earliest musical memories where you knew that music was meant to be a part of you and your purpose? Did your parents/family expose you to a lot of music?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">low leaf: </strong>We had a piano in the house growing up and as a baby, I loved to climb it and would end up hurting myself cause I could barely walk. My earliest memory of feeling the mystical presence of music was when I watched my older brother perform a Beethoven piece during a school talent show. His left thumb was broken and I found myself very much concerned and empathetic as a six year old, even nervous for him. But when he played, it was flawless. I remember losing myself in the music and feeling something I couldn't quite understand. It was the spirit of music moving everyone in the hall. I think that was the first time I experienced music in an audience, but also felt interconnectedness as the performer. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">amfm: </strong>How long have you been playing the harp and how did you get into it? Why the harp? What about it speaks to you?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">low leaf: </strong>My mom asked me if I wanted to play the harp, and once I was in the presence of a room full of harps I fell in love with their beautiful sound. I played beginner's folk harp from the 4th-6th grade, but after my harp teacher retired, I abandoned the instrument for years. I came back to it after I graduated from college because I wanted to sample it in my beats, remembering nothing I had learned, so I feel very much self-taught. The instrument itself is very entrancing and delicate, so I think it's transcendental qualities inspire me to write from a specific state of being, usually more emotional and always honest. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">amfm: </strong>You broke down the meaning behind your name Low Leaf as a process of growth and change, which perhaps alludes to the seasonal changes leaves go through, and being rooted. In reference to that sentiment, where do your roots lie and how have you seen yourself grow and evolve as a musician and a person through your music?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">low leaf: </strong>My roots lie in mother earth's soil, but her roots lie in a greater cosmic plane. As I've began to bloom inward, I'm finding my roots keep going deeper than I have ever imagined. The further I reach into my DNA, the more leaves, flowers, and fruit I produce, so it's an evolution process that happens holistically, and ends up expressing itself through my art and music inevitably. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">amfm: </strong>When describing your album Giga Gaia you said that you felt like there were these two distinct different sides of yourself and you were interested in bringing them together. What are those two sides, how would you describe them? Do you feel like you successfully meld the two?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">low leaf: </strong>Giga is the digital aspect of my music that comes to life by using machines, and Gaia represents my organic musical expression by way of using instruments like the piano, harp and guitar. I wanted to unify these seemingly separate aspects of myself and my music in a particular sound. The songs on the EP aren't exactly what I had in mind, but they are documentations of what happened during the ongoing processes of musing GigaGaia as if it was a planet that expressed itself through song. I will always be one embodying the two. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">amfm: </strong>You just came out with your new album AKASHAALAY, what was the inspiration behind the making this album? Was there anything you were trying to say (esp. with songs like Rise Up and Set Me Free)? What is the significance of the title?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">low leaf: </strong>The inspiration for my latest album AKASHAALAY was my Filipino heritage and lifelong yearning to reconnect to that source. AKASH in sanskrit means 'ether', and pag-AALAY in tagalog means 'an offering'. So, as this project is a vibratory offering to the Philippines, my intentions when creating it was speaking to the collective Filipino psyche and aiming to empower, reunite, and re-awaken my brothers and sisters. There are deep wounds in our past, and many stories unknown, and songs unheard, so as we are alive today as expressions of our living ancestors, and the spirit of life itself, we must utilize our time in these temporary bodies to revive our cultural, spiritual, and cosmic identity. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">amfm: </strong>If you weren't making music, what do you think you would be doing? What would you want to do if you had to have a &quot;conventional&quot; job?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-924af1a8-cbb0-dd89-edb3-9470b090b684">low leaf: </strong>Your &quot;job&quot; isn't necessarily what you do to make money. Even if I wasn't &quot;making music,&quot; I'd still be making music, if you know what I mean! But if I had a conventional job though, I'd definitely be a yoga teacher! <br />
