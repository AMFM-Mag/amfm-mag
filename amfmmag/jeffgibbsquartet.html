      <p><strong>Jeff Gibbs Quartet </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The Jeff Gibbs Quartet is a Chicago group of musicians with some serious chops making Jazz cool with their modern take on this classical style of music. Having grown up surrounded by music and encouraged to chase his musical dreams, Jeff Gibbs traded the cello for the saxophone and found his life&rsquo;s calling. With a strong team of fellow musicians to back him, including Cleo Bryrd on keyboards, DJ Abernathy on drums, and Jimmy Carter on bass, he has been able to elevate his musical aspirations and create a bigger sound that bends genres. </p>
      <p>The Quartet plays a mixture of musical styles, influenced by hip hop, soul, indie, mainstream, and a host of other inspirations, Jeff Gibbs playfully calls himself a &ldquo;musical mutt,&rdquo; for he doesn&rsquo;t want to be pigeonholed to one specific style or forced to stick only jazz roots. One minute they will be doing some traditional jazz and the next it can evolve into a jam session with a lil&rsquo; Kanye, Outkast or Disclosure thrown into the mix. Call it neo urban jazz if you will. Think of them in a way paying homage to the late great J Dilla, or along the likes of the Robert Glasper Experiment, they opened for them by the way. Comparisons aside, there is no question that The Jeff Gibbs Quartet is electrifying, cool, and as smooth as the vibes of their music. &nbsp;<br />

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">amfm: </strong>You started off	playing	the cello, what	about the saxophone spoke to you? Did you	choose it or did it choose you?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">jeff gibbs: </strong>I started playing cello when I was	in the 4th grade. At the time I only wanted to play an instrument because my older sister was in the band. However at the time I wasn't old enough to be in the band. So since I could only be in orchestra at the time I chose cello. I always grew up listening to saxophone. My dad would always be listening to jazz	when I was a kid, and I thought saxophone	was cool. So I guess I choose it!<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> Your upcoming debut release&quot;Road Less Traveled&quot; is about your upbringing with music,	can you describe your relationship and history with	music	a bit, growing	up was	music	a pivotal aspect of your life?</p>
      <strong>gibbs: </strong>Like many black musicians, I grew up playing in church. However that isn't	the typical	background for a saxophone	player.	I realized my musical	path was different when	I didn't	find myself looking up	jazz legends to study material. I played &nbsp;and learned music that felt good to me (hip hop,rock, pop, R&amp;B). Too often as artists we are told what is good and what&rsquo;s bad, and never really given a chance to develop an opinion. I was blessed to be given the chance to be a musical mix. Music always	has been pivotal in my life. It&rsquo;s gotten me through some of the most difficult times in life, as well as helped me celebrate the best and all in-between.<br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>You say you didn't go	about creating music	the &quot;normal way,&quot; and	 that you weren't	classically trained and didn't study musicians, but took elements of music	and made music	as you	felt, how has this approach helped make you the artist you	are today?</p>
      <strong>gibbs:</strong> I wouldn't say that I'm	not classically	trained. I was	in all the band	growing up from 5th grade through high school and also took	private	lessons, so I did have	someone to help me develop my skills; however	I wasn't stuck	in traditional thinking - the thought that	in order to be	successful in the arts,	you HAVE to pay homage and honor	 ALLLL	of the greats,	and if you can&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re not good enough to play. But like I said, I&rsquo;m a musical mix. Which	I	think is	the best thing	ever. I	have	a music vocabulary that is so	much more diverse	because I wasn't forced to study one	genre inside and out.<br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">amfm:</strong> You say &quot;Jazz is about evolution and freedom and the ideals of our country is built upon,&quot; what do you mean by this statement? How do the ideals of our country and jazz coincide to you?</p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">gibbs:</strong> I	 feel that jazz is a combination of individual thoughts, from each musician, that arebrought together to create one complete thought. A	thought that the common listener can	understand and develop an opinion from. Similar to	how our country is run. </p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">amfm: </strong>Why do you want to make Jazz cool	again?	What is cool about Jazz? <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">gibbs: </strong>Jazz is one of the few genres that got left in the slow lane. While these other genres evolved and passed it by. I feel like there is a lot of talent in this generation, however some legends from the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s are still in the top 20 popular records sold on iTunes. I think thats ridiculous. And I feel it&rsquo;s because the music has evolved but the listener hasn't. What influenced the players of the 50s or 60s isn&rsquo;t the same thing that influences me. Jazz is cool because it&rsquo;s honest, there&rsquo;s no hiding. Either you can express yourself fully or you can&rsquo;t. There are no rules, you can play &ldquo;giant steps&rdquo; then turn around and play &ldquo;No Church in the Wild&rdquo; and it be &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">amfm: </strong>You slate one of your biggest accomplishments thus far being opening for Robert Glasper (who I am amazed by! and you guys actually reminded me of such), what was that experience like for you? What are some of the other things on your music bucket list?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-477d7d67-f7ab-b3c1-b458-8025025f83d2">gibbs: </strong>That show was	awesome! Sold out crowd, the energy was amazing. I got a	 chance to talk	to Casey, the	saxophone player and a modern day	legend who is extremely	innovative, so	that was nothing short	 of amazing. The ultimate goal would be a Grammy	of	course! However, I want my music to do for people what music has done for me - inspire greatness.
