      <p><strong>Vonnie Quest</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">For photographer Vonnie Quest, taking pictures was just a gateway from his first love, film. He began shooting four years ago as a practice to help him strengthen his film skills for angling shots and capturing a slice of a moment. Quest grew up as a horror movie fiend, originally wanting to make his own slasher flicks, he took to the streets to begin capturing some beautiful images, quite the opposite of the blood and gore he was drawn to. </p>
      <p dir="ltr">His favorite things to capture are people and humanity, because he believes humans to be the most interesting subjects, whether it&rsquo;s candidly captured, strategically posed, or demanded on the spot. His photos have a grittiness to them, with a bit of a soft quiet stillness. His photos resemble his film background, the scene lying beneath them, frozen moments in time, suddenly brought to life through his lens. You can almost hear the hustle and bustle of the city, the calming rush of the bay beneath the Golden Gate Bridge, or feel the silence that lingers in an abandoned warehouse.      </p>

          The city of Chicago has always been an interesting place to me full of interesting people<strong>.</strong>This particular gentleman, who was homeless, was very interesting to say the least. He noticed my camera and demanded that I take his photograph. Me being a nice guy, I complied, but was a little caught off guard. I&rsquo;m like &ldquo; I don&rsquo;t have any cash as an incentive,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want cash, just take my picture.&rdquo; I took two shots of him; he thanked me and went on about his business. It was one of the weirdest street photography sessions that I have encountered thus far. &nbsp;After looking at the photos this one stood out to me.&nbsp;The spine chilling blank stare that he gives the camera is amazing. The lighting illuminated his face, and the depth of field was just right as he gazed into the lens. This was one of the best photos I have ever taken.

        <td><p>Me and a friend went location scouting and came across these old abandoned buildings on Milwaukee&rsquo;s Southside. It was very cool. I must admit that I was a little skeptical about going into an abandoned building, but I said &ldquo;Hey, there&rsquo;s graffiti on the walls, it can&rsquo;t be that bad.&rdquo; We went in. I really liked  the two door frame effect. <br />
          I enjoy the practice of framing shots with non-framed objects or pretty much anything with a unique shape.</p>

          In this piece I really focused on the buildings, <br />
          and how in my opinion, they really contrasted each other in color and in design. I also challenged myself to shoot at different angles. For this piece I would lie on my back with both arms stretch out toward the subject. I was pretty impressed by the results. In post-production I messed around with the contrast and saturation giving the buildings a feeling of isolation.<br />

        <td><p>This piece is shot in downtown San Francisco. The architecture in San Francisco was wonderful. While trying to find &ldquo; The Hundreds&rdquo; clothing store, I walked in to this piece. I literally stopped in mid walk looked down the block for a few seconds, and snapped the photo. At the time composition was heavy on my mind.

          My heart raced with excitement as we approached the Golden Gate Bridge, not really knowing what to expect made this first time experience all the more exhilarating. I felt the need to capture that moment and that feeling. <br />
          A feeling of being completely free, a feeling of embarking on a new quest, the feeling of soaring through the clouds. This was one of the best photos I have ever taken, and not solely because of the scenery or the location, but also because of how I felt when I captured the image. I would say it was that particular moment of adventure that inspired this piece.<strong><br />

        <td><p>I really enjoy shooting with this woman. She has a very beautiful spirit and a wonderful personality. You can&rsquo;t see her face because the focus should primarily be on the body and background. In this particular photo, I wanted to experiment with shapes. The model's hourglass shaped body, as well as the square and rectangular shapes in the background.</p>
