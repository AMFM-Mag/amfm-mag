      <p dir="ltr">Christopher McIntyre was the youngest artist to be included in the Wisconsin 30 exhibit to accompany the renowned 30 Americans exhibit at the Milwaukee Art Museum last year. But just because he&rsquo;s young, doesn&rsquo;t make him naive. He has seen a lot in these Milwaukee streets, and he has captured it with his camera. Because he didn&rsquo;t want to end up another statistic, with his camera, his words, and his drive, McIntyre took his future into his own hands, and changed his perception. He even legally changed his name to Christopher McIntyre Perceptions in that regard. </p>
      <p>His poetic images capture the culture of the city- the quiet normalcy, the dark nights and bright lights, and the constant hustle of it&rsquo;s inhabitants. His &ldquo;artlife&rdquo; demeanor and photography brings a semblance of heart to the bleak streets, the vibrant souls that reside here, and to creatives standing beside their city, trying to find a way to follow their passions against all odds. <strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>

        <td><p>I love the people of Detroit. There’s so much personality and flash here. This man calls himself Mr. Detroit. He has a wonderful walk that’s very elegant, and obviously in his dapper threads, it’s hard to miss him. I was instantly in love with him. I spent a little bit of time talking with him and learned that he’s been living in Detroit for a long, long time. I’m humbled by people like Mr. Detroit who have stayed in this city through the tough times. This city belongs to them. These pictures belong to them.</p>

          Sometimes I can feel a picture coming. In this case, I was driving around Southwest Detroit and I saw this fire. I wasn’t going to get out, but I was curious and rolled down the window to have a look. This is the closest I’d ever gotten to a house fire. I wondered what happened, is everyone OK, I felt sad that this the norm in Detroit. I was going to continue on, but when I saw this graphic on the adjacent wall, I reached for my camera. Something about it juxtaposed with the fire was interesting to me. Just as I did, this man in the hoodie turned to look at me. It was almost as if we were indicting each other. I think we’re all responsible for what has happened in Detroit in some ways.</p>

          This picture means a lot to me. It is a facade of an historic building, and you can see the downtown skyline peeking its way through its glass-less windows. In black and white, the facade looks almost charred. To me, this facade has become a metaphor for the impressions I had about Detroit when I didn’t really know the city. The impressions I got from the news, of Detroit as broken, foreboding, unwelcoming. These are the impressions that jail us, that prevent us from seeing the possibilities beyond. A city rising. I think it’s possible. </p>

          In my blog, I often use text to express my thoughts about picture, the process of taking the picture, the memories it evokes. Oftentimes, the text means more to me than the photo — simply because there is so much I want to say about Detroit and my relationship with the city. I call this picture, “The Performance No One Knows About.” Here’s what I wrote about it: &quot;When I was in New York a few weeks ago, someone asked me where I was from. ‘Detroit,' I said. 'Oh sorry.' Sometimes I chuckle to myself. Like last night, when I was walking around Eastern Market and seemingly out of nowhere, a troupe of modern dancers and jazz musicians begin weaving their way through the crowd, putting on a pop-up performance like nothing I've ever seen. I think to myself, my city, we will keep our little secret for now.”</p>

          Every <span data-term="goog_1529488642" tabindex="0">Tuesday</span>, I tutor at a Literacy Center on Grand River in Detroit. I was making my way back home, taking the long route, when I saw this man in the middle of the street with his newspapers and lollipops. I was attracted to his style, so I rolled down the window and asked if I could take a shot. I took about three frames, and just as he turned away, I got this one, which feels the most natural to me. I love that this photo looks vintage, but the newspaper headlines and the gas prices bring us back to today<strong><br />

          I took this photo just a few days ago on Memorial Day. So many people of all different cultures were out on the RiverWalk. I love that that this beautiful area of Detroit brings everyone together. This family caught my attention. I wondered how long they’ve been doing this - making memories in the city. This is a city that evokes no memories for me as a child. But strangely, at the same time, I feel like this city knows me. Now that I live here, we’re just writing our history together. </p></td>
