      <p><strong>The House Show</strong><strong> || May</strong> ||<br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">If Kanye can have his Dark Twisted Fantasy, The House Show can have its dark romantic symphony. This month&rsquo;s installment of Will Post&rsquo;s The House Show included performances from Herf Yamaya, Andrew Lothian, and Will Post, and the music that evening was beautiful, dark and sad. In most cases, one would not want to spend the a hot spring evening on a melancholy note, but there&rsquo;s something about these hand picked artists that blended together just in time for some springtime sadness in an emotional musical journey. </p>
Herf Yamaya was the first on the bill and performed songs from his musical project, &ldquo;Mother Mary and the Ritual Sadness,&rdquo; MMATRS for short. His voice with a soft rasp was backed by a big sound. Aside from lead vocals, Yamaya also played the guitar and was backed by an electric guitarist who made love to the strings, Will Post on piano and Elijah Noll, who did a solo set at the last show, was on the cajon drum, which gave it a rock jungle jam feel. Yamaya refers to himself as the ritual sadness, and that definitely set the tone for the deliberately darkness the audience was about to embark on. If this was sadness, this was sadness worth hearing. <br />
<p dir="ltr">Following Yamaya was the lulling serenade of Andrew Lothian, who only recently discovered Bon Iver after being compared to him so many times. His current body of songs are a form of cathartic healing from a love lost, and even loves never found. One of his most poignant songs was about two soulmates who wander through life never having found each other, so they exist in this &ldquo;telepathic loneliness&rdquo; which Lothian coined the night of the show, and decided to name the song. Beautifully tragic. Lothian is currently working on his first debut album which will be a symbolic closing of that chapter of his life, and perhaps we will hear song new songs about his current girlfriend. </p>
Will Post performed &ldquo;Experiment 41&rdquo; an old project of his about the universe and the vastness of it, our connection to it, and aspirations and dreams, beginning the set with a quote &ldquo;whether outwardly or inwardly, whether in space or time, the farther we penetrate the unknown, the vaster and more marvelous it becomes.&rdquo; Known for his operatic croon and his elaborate projections, he performed this time without his phantom mask. Post explores big theories, with a big voice and big music. He has such a classically trained voice and skills on the piano that he is certainly made to perform in opera houses and opera houses. Post was recently nominated for Best Conceptual Album for the Independent Music Awards for his album &ldquo;Panthenon.&rdquo; Perhaps one day he will graduate from house shows to arenas, but in the meantimes some select Chicagoans get to enjoy the intimacy that The House Show brings. <br />
<p dir="ltr">We were first introduced to the series back in March. The concept alone, an open house, music performances, drinks, food, and new friends is something sweet. Post informed me that their lease is up soon and life is settling for some of the organizers so the series is in a bit of limbo. Now that was the only thing sadder than the music that night. </p>
