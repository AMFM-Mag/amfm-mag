      <p dir="ltr"><strong>King Onye Label</strong></p>      <p>The whimsical and regal jewelry designings of King Onye Label is the brainchild of Nigerian Chicago jewelry designer, Oneka Ijeoma. Like most great ideas or businesses, the idea to create jewelry was born out of necessity and blossomed into a passionate life turn and she has been making pop up shops all over the city. Her designs are rooted in nature and its spiritual side with her use of branches, raw materials, and authentic precious stones from Africa and Southeast Asia. Ijeoma fuses this together with American vintage and a certain modern edginess. <br />
        <br />
        Her pieces are stylish and simple despite the intricacy that goes into them. Each piece is hand picked and unplanned until they are found and manipulated in a wiry assemblage. Pieces from her collection are a form or art, and activism, like her bullet branches, or pop cultural references, like the Onyeezus three tiered necklace <em>(pictured below)</em> which is a play on her name and Kanye West. From bullets and branches, to pennies, and gold plated pendants, King Onye is fit for royalty, or will make you feel as such when adorned with them. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> You are trying to show the &quot;glamour apparent through nature&quot; so your work aesthetics include crystals and things like tree bark and natural elements. Why are you drawn to these types of materials? What about them speaks to you and inspires your work? </p>
      <p><strong>king onye label:</strong> I am inspired by all things natural. Crystals are commonly seen used in my jewelry. I decided to challenge myself and come up with something that is natural but unique. Beauty of all types inspires my work, its very spiritual because the process of picking up branches in the park is very spiritual. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>You began making jewelry to make ends meet and pay for books back in college, why did you decide that jewelry making was the route for you? How did you get into jewelry making and how did it evolve into a label? </p>
      <p><strong>onye: </strong>It was meant to be. I had a large collection of vintage jewelry and borrowed a friend’s tools one night and just went at it.. &quot;Self taught&quot; you might say. The creativity that I use to make my jewelry just evolved into creativity as a business owner, for example I realized that I could create my own channels like online shops and mini markets, which appeals to my true self more than anything I ever formally studied. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>You said that jewelry making also began as a form of therapy and in a way self actualization. How has it been therapeutic for you and how has your work highlighted some of the issues in the world as you relate to your social justice background? </p>
      <p><strong>onye: </strong>The mere fact that all of these elements are recognized as elements from the Earth gives my work an inherently spiritual undertone. I am always drawn to that which invokes individuals to not only &quot;think deeper,&quot; but &quot;appreciate deeper.&quot; I don't personally get into social justice as a school of thought or action anymore, underlying all social issues is a simple more beautiful truth that unites all people and my work represents that. I start and end at the heart of the matter. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What is your design process like? Do you have an image or idea, or do you take a hands on approach? </p>
      <p><strong>onye: </strong>Definitely, hands on. There isn't any thought attached to what I make. It’s all based on feeling. I literally go to the park, pick up the branches that speak to me and work with them. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Your pieces are elegant, yet edgy, you call them &quot;street regal,&quot; how do you juxtapose the two of these concepts into your work as a whole? to make a cohesive piece? How about this idea of &quot;street regal&quot; in your life? </p>
      <p><strong>onye: </strong>These concepts are no longer exclusive. We live in a world where rappers like Kanye are mixing beats with samples from Mozart. Nobody questions it anymore; it’s evolution. I best bring that evolution to the design world. Yin and Yang, contrast is an ancient concept, period. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> One of your most popular pieces are your tree branch bullet cap pieces, which represents life growing out of death, can you describe this concept and what it means to you? </p>
      <p><strong>onye:</strong> It was an unconscious creation so to speak. From a design point I love how basic it is, the branch is growing out of a shell. On a customer service level I allow my clients to make up their own meaning, I've had people who have overcome some serious life difficulties tell me their story and other people who just dig the look. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> You said you want people to think about something in a new way through jewelry, how do you strive to do this? </p>
      <p><strong>onye:</strong> Value is the main idea that my jewelry-art invokes. The World Coins Necklace is filled with beautiful coins from all around the world, in America we don’t value our pennies enough! Our money says &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, its very beautiful really...</p>
