      <p><strong>Pitchfork Day One</strong></p>
      <p>With the Chicago weather finally hitting summer temperatures, opening day of Pitchfork was scorching, but that didn’t stop festival goers from basking, and “baking” in the sun to the day’s performers which included, I Love Makonnen, Mac DeMarco, Chvrches, Panda Bear and the Chicago natives, Wilco. A couple of people got carried away, probably due to a mixture of extreme heat, drugs and alcohol, and ended up getting whisked away to the Emergency tent. Other than that, Pitchfork festival was going up on Friday. </p>

      <p class="content"><em>(I Love Makonnen)</em></p>
      <p>I Love Makonnen performed his trap classics over heavy bass, touting throughout his set how much of a dream come true this was. Singing the praises of Molly, Nokia flip phones, and Tuesdays, Makonnen brought us a touching moment where he brought out his phone and FaceTimed his mother on stage and thanked her for all of her support to get him there, performing in front of thousands of people at Pitchfork. He then told her he was going to play her favorite song “No Ma’am,” ‘My momma asked me if I was still trappin, I said no Ma’am,” repeated throughout most of the song. I’m sure she’s real proud. </p>

      <p>Mac DeMarco was a joy to hear and a highly anticipated act of the day. His croon could put the guy from “In The Jungle” out of business. Chvrches played on the stage after DeMarco and the many strewn cigarette butts left behind and took a moment out of their set to give the crowd a PSA on how disgusting cigarettes are and smoking is. “They give you throat cancer, which is a perfect way to segway into this next song called ‘By The Throat,’ no pun intended.” This was the Scottish band’s first U.S. visit in a very long time, coming just on the heel of their announcement of a U.S tour for their upcoming sophomore album. They performed some new tunes and delivered an upbeat, electronic laden set paired with Lauren Mayberry’s soft voice. She also took the time out to shout of the US Women’s World Cup Winners and women in sports. They ended their set with “The Mother We Share.” </p>
      <p><img src="../images/amfmmag/wilco.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="wilco" /><em class="content">(Jeff Tweedy, Wilco)</em></p>
      <p>Closing out the night were the headliners, legendary rockers, Wilco. These guys, Jeff Tweedy, pat Sansone and crew were veterans to the stage. They were also riding the momentum from having just dropped all the tracks from their entire new album “Star Wars” just days before onlin. They performed the songs from the start of the new album to the end for a good hour, and then closed out the final hour with old hits over nightfall and a beautiful sunset. <br />
