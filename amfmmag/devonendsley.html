      <p><strong>Devon Endsley</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Roles of men and women used to be very cut and dry. Men worked, women tended to the house and children. Things have obviously evolved immensely over time. Traditions have changed, society has changed, women and men have changed, and what defines the two have also. What does it mean to be a man in a growingly feminist world? What place and what roles do men have in this changing scope? What is masculinity and how is it portrayed through the lense of femininity? These are the types of questions that photographer Devon Endsley is seeking to explore and answer through her &ldquo;Sizing Up Masculinity&rdquo; photo series. </p>
      Set in front of colorful, floral backdrops, Endsley sizes up portraits of men. Their femininity is heightened, and masculinity subdued and sometimes masked. She portrays men in a whimsical fashion, embellishing them for the camera and the result is a quite beautiful display of the modern male according to Endsley.
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">amfm: </strong>Why do you like taking pictures? What kinds of social issues are you most drawn to with your photography and why? How do you think the lens can be used to make a commentary about those things?<br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">devon endsley: </strong>I like taking pictures because it allows me to take control of my own thoughts, feelings, and opinions and creatively communicate them to the public. While my work may be attempting to tackle another issue more directly, there has always been an underlying theme of identity in my work. In the past year especially, my photography has been concentrating on how women empowerment is shifting our understanding of gender identity and the roles our gender is expected to play. Examples of shifted gender roles can already be seen amongst our youth, and it is because I believe that the power of change begins with youth that I feel personally drawn to this issue as a young individual. I believe the lens can bring attention to and raise awareness of social issues such as gender roles and identity in modern America. It may not result in direct answers for individuals, but it can provide a platform for conversation, and in turn possibly challenge previously conceived notions, opening a door for change and acceptance. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">amfm: </strong>Why did you want to tackle this topic about men, especially being a woman an interpreting it through that lens? Did you speak with any men or have any conversations about where you felt their place or role in the world was or was shifting towards? Did you talk to other women?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">endsley: </strong>I wanted to tackle this topic of masculinity in modern America because I am a woman who intends to live my life as an equal amongst men. And since this is not as the world exists now, as the push towards gender equality is being made, I believe it is important to be mindful of how changes in gender roles will affect gender identity. I have spoken with many of my male friends about my feelings and opinions on modern gender roles, and asked for their feedback. When I was trying to grasp men&rsquo;s ideas of masculinity, I asked my friends, &ldquo;what do you think it means to be a man?&rdquo; and often times the response was that a man is someone who protects his family. To which my response is, protect his family from what? From intruders? From starvation? From poverty? And what if a male doesn&rsquo;t have a family to protect? Does this mean he&rsquo;s lost his chance at manhood? And as we live in a time where many women are single mothers, do we consider them masculine if they successfully protect and care for their family? As I proceeded to ask men what their opinions are on ideas of what it means to masculine in today&rsquo;s America, many reacted with a self-aimed laugh and began to open up about their feelings of insecurity due to not fitting the idealized male persona. While these young men know well that they are male, their quality of masculinity is questioned by society if they don&rsquo;t like sports, have muscles, or invest interest in sports cars. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">amfm: </strong>What do you think is the modernized definition of masculinity? How did you try to depict this through your photo imagery? Why place them in front of these backdrops and pose them and dress them this way?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">endsley: </strong>In my opinion, the modernized definition of masculinity is one that is accepting of previously considered feminine qualities, behaviors, and roles as now gender neutral. Thus the modern male can carry these qualities, behaviors, or roles without their masculinity being questioned. I tried to depict this idea of embracing femininity within masculinity by visually punching up the idea to the point of embellishment. I chose the backdrops I did to emphasize the influence femininity has on masculinity. I wanted to engulf my male subjects in feminine colors and patterns so that the audience would view them with a feminine gaze as I had. And, how interesting that if draped in pastels and floral patterns men suddenly look as though they are unafraid to feel – that they have a level of sensitivity that wasn&rsquo;t there before. But the sensitivity was there before, it just wasn&rsquo;t displayed, because it is considered unfashionable to express it; sensitivity will emasculate a male if he shows too much – that is what society has taught us. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">amfm: </strong>Why do you think or perceive that the modern world has shifted from a &quot;man's world&quot; to a feminist world?  What way do you think that men have been pushed aside?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">endsley: </strong>I do not believe that the world is no longer a man&rsquo;s world, but I do believe that modern America has become more accepting of the feminist movement. I believe that as women empower themselves to take on positions that have formerly been reserved for men, the expectations of gender roles have shifted. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">amfm: </strong>What is the significance of the title &quot;Sizing Up Masculinity&quot;?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">endsley: </strong>The significance behind the title &ldquo;Sizing Up Masculinity&rdquo; is to indicate that masculinity is without an agreed upon modern definition, and that our previous perceptions of masculinity need to be reassessed to better define how men display masculinity today. As I take into consideration the common fluidity between genders seen especially in my generation and those younger, I am interested in determining what makes a man masculine (and consequently what makes a woman feminine) in a time when unisex and androgyny is becoming increasingly common. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">amfm: </strong>Do you find that if you were to take the same social issues and do a photo series here in Milwaukee versus your hometown in Texas if that would change create the same result? For instance, does a snapshot of what it looks like to be a man here differ than that of what it means to be a man in Texas?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-658bdf8a-916f-41c5-8702-a2c614bcaa0d">endsley: </strong>I believe that the behaviors and gender roles of men are modernizing throughout America. However, I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if the results from a larger city like Milwaukee varied from the results of a suburban town in Texas. Social norms in attire and activities vary based on location and so I would be interested in finding out if there is a difference, and if so, what it is.</p>
