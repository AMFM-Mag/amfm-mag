        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Dear Detroit,</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The last night of DEMF after an amazing set from Bonobo, I embarked on a six and a half hour drive back home to Milwaukee. I didn&rsquo;t think about how tired I was after dancing and partying for three days straight, nor was I cursing the torrential downpour for further impairing my fatigued eyes as I passed by highway signs that read &ldquo;Fatigued driving is just as bad as drunk driving.&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about any of those things, I was thinking about Detroit and how inspired I felt, mentally, artistically, and culturally. A lot of this trip was a recharging of creativity. Despite the festival&rsquo;s toll on my day to day energy, I constantly felt invigorated. I had the perfect balance of energies staying at the Field Street Collective with my old yoga teacher. Yoga retreat by day, rave by night. </p>
<p dir="ltr">It was my third time in Detroit. Twice now for the festival, and once for some soul searching. A couple years ago I rented a car and drove to Detroit, not knowing a soul, and having never been before.The first person I met was a guy named Burt who was staying at the Hostel Detroit, where I was staying. Within five minutes of parking my car, he greeted me with a story I will remember to this day of how he was stabbed in broad daylight only a block away from the hostel and almost died.  Then he posed the question, &ldquo;Why the fuck would you come to Detroit?!&rdquo; Talk about first impressions. He was an ex heroin addict, and was staying in the hostel with his girlfriend because his house burnt down.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scary at first, but most things are. Every time I come to Detroit I have a newfound appreciation for the city. The most common thing I heard being there was that Detroit was full of some of the realest people you will ever meet, and that sentiment holds true. I haven&rsquo;t met one bad person yet. Burt wasn&rsquo;t so bad either. He showed me around as we cruised downtown in my rental, showing me the Fox Theatre, The Heidelberg project and told me his story.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">When he asked me why Detroit, at the time I didn&rsquo;t know, but I sure do now.
