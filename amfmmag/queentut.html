      <p><strong>Queen Tut</strong><br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">Seshat Queen Tut crowned herself well before she began performing for the public, but it didn&rsquo;t take long for the confident emcee to gain loyal subjects. Tut made a splash in her debut feature, inviting listeners to join her artistic journey on the opening verse of AR Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Drug Flow RMX.&rdquo; Since then she&rsquo;s laced her royal rhymes on fellow Milwaukee musicians&rsquo; material and even graced the Summerfest stage with <a href="lexallen.html">Lex Allen</a>. Under a Super Blood Moon on Sunday night Tut held the release party for her first official project, the &ldquo;Psychedelic Traphouse&rdquo; EP. She&rsquo;s an affiliate of the <a href="NAN.html">New Age Narcissism</a> collective and SAFS crew, having accomplished all of this in less than a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The five-song EP encapsulates Tut&rsquo;s myriad influences and musical tastes. She pays homage to Jimi Hendrix on one song, sings with Abby Jeanne REBEL LOVE (who co-produced the EP) on another, and displays her equally smooth and razor sharp flow on each. To see Tut perform live takes her music to another level. She commands the stage with a ferocious sweetness, complemented by a beautifully bold sense of style. Tut is most at home when surrounded by fellow creatives and she&rsquo;s thrived off Milwaukee&rsquo;s bubbling music scene. Sunday night brought together a diverse lineup of performers and audience members who helped Tut celebrate both her EP release and her birthday in style.<br />

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm: </strong>You moved around a lot as a kid and went to a bunch of different schools. Did that make it difficult to create your identity? And what are the major influences that informed your identity?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut: </strong>I think moving around a lot actually preserved my identity. Meeting new people constantly changes your perspective and reminds you how important your identity is to you. Growing up, I felt like the world was trying to silence me. It was difficult for me as a kid because I so desperately wanted to be myself. I was always going against some dress code, or going my own way when my friends would follow trends. My influences are vast, and come from everywhere from Tim Burton to Pam Grier.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm: </strong>On the song &ldquo;Carrie&rsquo;s Revenge&rdquo; off your debut EP you and fellow Milwaukee emcee Zed Kenzo rap about the tribulations of being weirdos. What is your message to people who bully and hate on those who are eccentric and different?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut: </strong>My message is simple. It is courageous to walk out of your home knowing who you are, what you look like, and what you believe in, which may upset people to the point that they single you out. It is not courageous to walk outside wearing a disguise that makes you just as uncomfortable or unhappy. Life is too short to walk around being anyone but yourself.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm: </strong>When we first talked at the beginning of the summer you were super new to the Milwaukee music scene, but people were already seeking you out. How did it feel to get that recognition early on?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut: </strong>It was humbling. To he honest, I never thought for a second people would respond to my work in this way. I have/had no expectations, so when anybody recognizes me or shows love, I'm always thankful and appreciative. As a female emcee, it feels amazing to be welcomed so warmly by a scene dominated by male performers.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm: </strong>You said one of your summer plans was to immerse yourself in the local music scene. What have you learned so far?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut:</strong> I've learned that this city is filled with hidden gems. Milwaukee has so much talent and potential. The bands and collectives in our backyard need our support, and if we show enough love, our music scene can get the recognition it deserves.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm: </strong>This summer you went to Afropunk in Brooklyn. What did you draw from that experience?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut:</strong> Afropunk was my dream come true. I always wanted to go and felt like this year was the right time. Seeing Lauryn Hill, Grace Jones, Kelis, Lenny Kravitz, and newcomers like Kelela and SZA shaped my journey, and opened my eyes to how necessary music with a message is.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm:</strong> Sunday was your EP release party, under the Super Blood Moon no less. In terms of packing people in, Sunday isn&rsquo;t the best night of the week. But there were so many fellow creatives in the room, from New Age Narcissism to Fivy to Klassik to milo to Nathaniel from Group of the Altos, not to mention all the talent that shared the stage with you. It felt like an Industry Night. What did it mean to have all of those prolific artists under one roof in support of your debut project?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut: </strong>The release party was nothing short of a surreal experience for me. The eclectic mix of people, talent, and genres the show brought in was the epitome of my vision. I love all my fellow creatives, and it was humbling to see them all in the audience. The support of my community made me feel so empowered and welcome. I thank them all for coming out and showing love.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">amfm: </strong>Before coming to your release party I was at the Milwaukee Film Festival and saw the trailer for a documentary about the 94-year-old fashion icon Iris Apfel. Where does your style come from and how important is fashion to you?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0e4e62cc-26d1-cb05-24ee-0604a5b7e136">queen tut: </strong>My style is inspired by world cultures, my experiences, and art. I don't box myself in and I allow myself freedom of expression. Fashion isn't necessarily extremely important to me. I'm more about the aesthetic. I prefer great personal style over big labels. <br />
