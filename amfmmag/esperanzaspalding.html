      <p><strong>Esperanza Spalding: Emily D's + Evolution </strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Esperanza Spalding graced the stage of Lincoln Hall, for not just one, but two nights to showcase her latest project Emily D&rsquo;s + Evolution. The project is a dream come reality. Spalding says she had a dream one night during a full moon, and dreamt up the series. It was a nod to her childhood fantasies of theater and song. The show was just that, fantastical and a musical journey inside her mind with visuals, videos and stage acts performed before the sold out crowd. </p>
      Folks who have never seen Spalding, and without any background on the series, may have been a bit confused, but the show did not disappoint. She still delivered a stellar performance and wowed the audience with her amazing bass and acting skills. She and her stage band came out crouched over, walking the perimeter of the stage before a projected backdrop of mountains, then they took their positions, and all the fun ensued! <br />
      <br />      
      They kicked off the set with &ldquo;Good Lava,&rdquo; and interspersed throughout the performances were mini skits. The stage was set up to enact various different scenes. For her song &ldquo;Nobles Nobles&rdquo; Spalding and her band did a mock graduation procession stopping at a podium, smiling and hurraying as they received their &ldquo;diplomas.&rdquo; Spalding then unraveled the scroll and they began to quickly tout off revolutionary rhetoric, that was mimicked to be the fineprint of American nationalism and education, almost too quickly to comprehend, but I think that was the intention. They adorned her with a crown made of branches, leaves and wildflowers. <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Doing powerstances, Spalding looked regal, until she came to the realization that she didn&rsquo;t want to be a noble and succumb to the power of prestige and societal norms and they in union began to chant &ldquo;Funk the fear, live your life&rdquo; before completely delving into the song &ldquo;Funk the Fear.&rdquo; This was an anthem moment of the night, the audience began reciting it back and the energy in the room was electric, especially given all the turmoil of society lately. </p>
      Another standout performance was &ldquo;Elevator Operator&rdquo; where Spalding sat before a piano, dressed as a bellhop, singing out &ldquo;whiskey blues,&rdquo; over a country-folk like musical backing from her band. She then began to spiral into an semi pyschotic episode where she then went crazy on the keys, banging and knocking things over, like a hurricane or earthquake was hurdling through her before she fell still at the keys. <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Spalding&rsquo;s guitarist also brought forth one of the most amazing guitar solos I have ever seen. He went from from chord to chord, his fingers on fire, without any breaks in between. You could see the intensity in his eyes, hear his breath and his lips count. &nbsp;Amidst crowd cheers and flabberghasted commentary, the audience was completely awestruck, as he and Spalding both fed off of eachother&rsquo;s energy. </p>      Her last &ldquo;song&rdquo; of the evening was &ldquo;Unconditional Love,&rdquo; a love song about great love, the true meaning of that concept, and the facades within. I happened to be standing next to a couple, who began to gaze longingly into the other&rsquo;s eyes, feeling as though they had found that in each other. Before ending the night and the dream, Spalding and her band returned for one more recitation, &ldquo;Help Me.&rdquo; The show was truly unlike any other concert experience. It was a powerful display of her many talents and her eccentric side, and it was just the warm up for the following night.<strong> &nbsp;</strong> <br />
