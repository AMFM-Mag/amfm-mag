      <p><strong>Lili K</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Lili K is Chicago&rsquo;s very own precious stone, and that stone is a ruby. Coming off of releasing her first debut album, <em>Ruby</em>, this soulful jazz songstress is making tidal waves in the Chicago music scene, and is definitely having a rippling effect across the musical spectrum. You may know of her from her song &ldquo;Hey Ma&rdquo; with Chance the Rapper, or Klassik&rsquo;s song &quot;This is That New&rdquo; out of Milwaukee, but what you should know her for is the gem that is her album. <em>Ruby</em> is Lili K, stripped down to her roots, her heart, and done <em>her</em> way in her voice, which is sometimes strong and bellowing, at times soft and sultry, or playful and fun when she scats in a musical adlib.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Lili K is like sugar, honey, mollasses, and then some - anything but artificial sweetner, which she cleverly mentions in her song &ldquo;Pour Some Sugar on It.&rdquo;  Backed by a full band, <em>Ruby</em> melts in your ears, with raw elements of the recording process, like the scratch of a guitar, included in the sound, which make you feel like you&rsquo;re right there in the studio being serenaded like you&rsquo;re the one she&rsquo;s singing to in &ldquo;Tommy.&rdquo; &nbsp;She is also quite possibly one of the most hard working and humble artists in the game. Although she is returning to some of music&rsquo;s classic roots through jazz, she does it with a modern flair and it is quite refreshing.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">amfm: </strong>So <em>Ruby</em> is the first time you've released a full length album solely for yourself after having successfully worked with some of Chicago and Milwaukee hip-hop artists, and shared the stage with some well known artists as well, doing a bit of poetry in your early beginnings too, how have all of these experiences helped prepare you to go off on your own? When did you decide it was finally your turn and decide to take that leap? </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">lili k: </strong>I've always loved music because of how happy it makes me. Collaborating, and doing feature work have all been amazing experiences, but they made me miss my roots. I just reached a point where I felt like I wasn't doing what I truly wanted to do - so I decided it was time to make <em>Ruby </em>happen. I learned from my surroundings, I practiced my craft, and I got to work. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">amfm: </strong>Although you have a lot of music in the hip-hop genre with your collaborations, your real passions lie with jazz music and that's what this album is comprised of. What is it about jazz that you are drawn to? You said you learned about the power of music at an early age, what was the power of jazz that drew you in? What were some of your early introductions to the genre? </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">lili k: </strong>I was first introduced to Motown, soul, and gospel as a kid. These influences are still prevalent in my music, but hearing jazz for the first time was a huge game-changer for me. When I first heard Ella Fitzgerald, I was around 11, and something just clicked inside of me. I don't have that heavy, gorgeous, belting type voice - I was given a jazz voice, and at that point, my voice started to make sense to me. I began studying jazz vocalists, my choir teacher at school started working with me, and I started to embrace my sound. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">amfm: </strong>You speak about letting go in your music and said that letting go has always been a been difficult. Was there ever a moment for you where you didn't think music was something you wanted to continue to pursue? What have been some challenges for you in pursuing your dreams? What has been the most rewarding? </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">lili k: </strong>Music is something that I'll always do - whether it's a hobby or my career. This is a really tough industry to 'make it' in, and there are definitely times where you question what you're doing. You have to have a clear goal in mind in order to stay sane, you have to know what you're willing to sacrifice. I've dealt with bad people, I've dealt with selfish people - that's always disheartening. But every little success feels amazing when you truly work your butt off for it. Completing my self-produced, debut album and seeing people buy it has been an amazing experience. I still get all giddy every time I see it on iTunes, Spotify, or Tidal. Performing to audiences who sing every word with me, that's a crazy feeling. I think the most rewarding experiences have been talking with my fans, and hearing how my music has impacted their lives, gotten them through a rough time, things like that. That makes me feel so incredibly lucky to be doing what I'm doing. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">amfm: </strong>Having successfully completed your first solo album, what would you say has been your biggest takeaway in making <em>Ruby</em>? What do you know now that you didn't know before day one? What would your 23 year old self tell your 20 year old self? What about your 16 year old self? </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">lili k: </strong>My biggest takeaway from creating <em>Ruby</em> - BELIEVE IN YOURSELF! It's important to stay humble and to evaluate yourself, but self-assurance and self-confidence is even more important. I was doubting my abilities, questioning my choices, seeking approval from others... and I finally took a deep breath, stopped listening to my insecurities, and made Ruby on my own - the way I wanted to make it. I worked REALLY hard and raised the money to record, mix, and master the project. I handpicked my band because of their individual talents and styles so that they could bring out my ideas. I would say &quot;Surround yourself with people you genuinely LOVE being around, not the people who are 'cool' to be around.&quot; I would say &quot;Don't wait on anybody to make something happen for you, make it happen for yourself.&quot; </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">amfm: </strong>You said you named the album <em>Ruby</em> after your birthstone and because your mother has given you a ruby for certain milestones, did she give you a ruby for completing your first album? I'm sure you're going to rack up a lot of rubies in your lifetime and career, you might not have enough fingers! Do you wear them often of keep them someplace special? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">lili k: </strong>Haha! My mom did give me a ruby ring for <em>Ruby</em>! I don't have too many right now, but I keep them in a special jewelry box. I'll break them out every once in awhile, but I try to keep them just for special occasions.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">amfm: </strong> Describe the feeling or ambiance you want to evoke in people from first listen of<em> Ruby</em>.  </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-30fb9d43-7701-3fa3-3ebf-506c6527abf1">lili k: </strong>I want people to feel warm, happy, relaxed. Imagine sitting on a porch in the summer, playing board games with a friend or lover, and listening to records. I'd like <em>Ruby</em> to be one of those records.<br />
