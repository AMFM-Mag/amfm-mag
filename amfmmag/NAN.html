      <p><strong>NAN || Summer Solstice Festival || Milwaukee</strong><br />
        <br />
Since its inception 15 years ago Milwaukee&rsquo;s Summer Soulstice Music Festival has yet to feature a hip-hop act as their headliner. That changed on Saturday night when the New Age Narcissism (NAN) collective took the stage. Two of the event&rsquo;s main organizers, Chuck Watson and Aron Smith (MC Oneself), were once members of the iconic Milwaukee hip-hop group the Rusty Pelicans (who will celebrate their 20th anniversary later this year), said it was a goal of theirs to book a hip-hop act at Soulstice. During NAN&rsquo;s 414 Live session at 88Nine Radio Milwaukee, bandleader Q the Sun spoke on the significance of the Soulstice booking. </p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been playing live hip-hop music like this for a long time and it&rsquo;s the first seeing a hip-hop headlining slot on the East Stage, so this is a momentous occasion in that regard and we&rsquo;re coming with full force.&rdquo; When 88Nine&rsquo;s Ken Sumka asked NAN which acts they were excited to see at Soulstice they were hard-pressed to offer a response. Though they eventually mentioned Canopies, Soul Low and Aluar Pearls, Q the Sun admitted, &ldquo;To be honest, we&rsquo;re just so focused on putting on the best possible performances we can, so that&rsquo;s all we have in our minds right now.&rdquo;</p>
      <p><img src="../images/amfmmag/NANQtheSun.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="nanQ" /><em>NAN : Q the Sun</em> </p>
      <p dir="ltr"> True to Q&rsquo;s words, NAN delivered the best performance of the day and perhaps their best performance to date. I&rsquo;ve been following the collective since their breakout appearance at the 88Nine Radio Milwaukee Awards back in December and the Soulstice set was a fantastic representation of their talents. In a nod to the historic hip-hop booking, their set opened with appearances by Dana Coppafeel &amp; SPEAK Easy, as well as Klassik. Then the New Age Narcissism experience began.</p>
<p>Summer Soulstice would be NAN&rsquo;s s second week in a row holding headlining duties. The first was at Locust Street Festival and the strict 8pm curfew almost deprived the throbbing crowd at the Riverwest Public House Stage of NAN&rsquo;s most popular song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-lyPBro7fw" target="_blank">&ldquo;Doomsday feat. Siren&rdquo; by WebsterX</a>. Before finishing their set at Locust Street, they ran through a shortened version of &ldquo;Doomsday&rdquo; while their friends and family danced with them onstage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Saturday night NAN made sure to get &ldquo;Doomsday&rdquo; in by kicking off their set with the trippy, haunting, anthemic banger. WebsterX got his crowd dive in early too. I spoke with Q the Sun that night and he told me that he has aligned himself with Siren, Lorde Fredd33, Lex Allen and WebsterX because &ldquo;they&rsquo;re all incredible performers - they&rsquo;re rockstars.&rdquo; Q&rsquo;s words rang true once again as each member of NAN slayed the East Stage at Soulstice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The backing band consisted of Tim Russell on drums (a first), Bo Triplex on bass, D&rsquo;Amato on vocals, Chris G. on drum pad and Q the Sun on keys. At Paddy&rsquo;s Pub after the show my friend commented that each NAN performer &ldquo;did a hockey shift, two minutes and they&rsquo;re out.&rdquo; It was more like two songs and they&rsquo;re out. Siren has inspired sing-a-longs for her unreleased anthem &ldquo;Queen Medusa,&rdquo; but Saturday saw the first time the chorus of her unreleased song &ldquo;Paper Dolls&rdquo; was shouted back at her en masse. </p>

<p dir="ltr">A veil- and silk-shirt-adorned Lex Allen delivered his most confident and fun version of &ldquo;Puppy Love.&rdquo; Lorde Fredd33 fiercely sprayed the crowd with water before parting the audience and rapping &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; among them, while accompanied by the sultry Abby Jeanne. NAN closed the night with WebsterX's &quot;Desperate Youth,&quot; their rallying cry that has become a sort of tribal ritual at this point in which their whole crew mobs the stage, everyone (crowd included) gets low for the slow parts, then goes wild when the beat drops.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">NAN is a culture, a movement. It is bigger than hip-hop and bound for glory. As Aron Smith exclaimed at the end of their Soulstice set, &ldquo;This is homegrown Milwaukee hip-hop for the world!&rdquo; If Soulstice was a warm-up for Summerfest, the NAN performance was a warm-up for Lex Allen&rsquo;s June 26 gig and WebsterX&rsquo;s July 3 opening slot for Lupe Fiasco, both at <a href="http://summerfest.com/" target="_blank">Summerfest</a>. <em>[Joey Grihalva]</em></p>
