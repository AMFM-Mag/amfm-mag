      <p><strong>THEESatisfaction</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Whatever you do, you can&rsquo;t funk with THEESatisfaction&rsquo;s groove. The Seattle-based rapper Stasia &quot;Stas&quot; Irons and singer Catherine &quot;Cat&quot; Harris-White met back in college before they became queens and released their debut album AwE NaturalE back in 2012. They found their claim to fame when they collaborated with Shabazz Place&rsquo;s back in 2011. They are currently working on a second album due out later this year.  Music has always been a passion of theirs. On &ldquo;Wee Sounds Weird&rdquo; on one of their earlier EP&rsquo;s, Stas raps &ldquo;Without music I would be dead/ So I use it and spread revolution.&rdquo; The two are like modern day black panthers that make music. </p>
      Their chillback, psychedelic neo-soul vibes, mixed with hip-hop, funk and a bit of spoken word are not the only thing that make their music listen worthy, they actually have a lot of important things to say. Both are queer black women and their experiences with that intersectionality have heavily influenced their music. From Malcolm X samples to spirituality and sexuality, their music explores many different themes in a philosophical manner. They also throw awesome parties under the guise of &ldquo;Black Weirdo,&rdquo; a movement they started of queer expression and black consciousness. <strong><br />
      </strong>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>How did the two of you meet? You guys used to see each other around at open mics when you were in college? How did that evolve into the two of you teaming up to make music? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">cat:</strong> I used to hang around the University of Washington trying to get involved with activities and events. I didn't go there, but I was always around haha. Then I would see Stas around at open mic nights and we connected. Been buds ever since. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">stas: </strong>We always bonded over music. Back in college we used to jam out to Georgia Anne Muldrow, Jill Scott, Ella Fitzgerald, Miguel, J*Davey and always Michael Jackson. Cat let me sing back-up for her senior recital and that was the first unofficial THEESat show.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">amfm: </strong>You guys released your debut album &quot;AwE NaturalE&quot; back in 2012 and are in the works of a new album to be released later this year. How has it been working on the new material? How does this album differ than the last and how have you seen yourselves and your music evolve since then? What were guys doing in the two years in between? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">cat: </strong>It feels weird to have released an album. A cool weird strange feeling. It's exciting because after all that time of writing or producing or just humming a tune, it exists for all to digest. The new music is the tops though. I think I feel that way every time. I love all our songs, but these new ones are pretty ingrained in me. So much has changed since the release of awE naturalE, but it's nice to get ready for the next projects.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">stas: </strong>Working on the new album was a challenge, but it was also very exciting. We are constantly working on music so some of the jams pick up where awE naturalE left off, but the topics are a little more mature. We've both grown a lot as producers and songwriters, this album utilizes different instruments and programming. In between the two years of these projects we've traveled the world, we've thrown parties under our brand Black Weirdo, and we've had some ups and downs like most humans do. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">amfm: </strong>You describe your music as a compilation of short stories, and orating rather than rapping, and you sound off about real social issues. What kind of stories are you trying to tell? What kind of stories do you think need to be told for you two as artists and individuals? Have you ever had people misread them?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">cat: </strong>The music is for me, honestly. I'm super selfish about it. If I don't like it, it won't be released until I do. So I tell stories of enchantment and magic. Mythical doses of reality to soothe and explore the listeners journey. People read our lyrics wrong all the time. Like literally read/hear them incorrectly. Hahaha. But it's cool. If that's what you wanted to get out of it, that is what you will receive. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">stas:</strong> I love to create my own stories as well as rehash things that my family and friends have bestowed. Stories of personal redemption, science, social commentary, love, lust, drunken ramblings and book adaptations. It all depends on how the beat feels. I can't judge how someone interprets the art, I want the listener explore it and take whatever they want from it.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">amfm: </strong>Have the two of you always been into making music? Do you remember any early childhood memories where music was involved? What do you think you would be doing if you weren't making music? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">cat: </strong>Music was a big part of my upbringing. My family would often hold dance parties in the living room and quiz me on what we were listening to. Music is so freeing. If I wasn't singing or producing I would still be writing. I love to write. But maybe public relations or strategic advising.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">stas: </strong>I also come from a very musical family. My mother tells me I was singing in my baby swing at six months old. I was always in some choir, or trying to learn an instrument. I have no idea what I'd be doing if I wasn't making music. I'm completely in love with it. I'd probably work at some meaningless job that allowed me to have headphones on. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">amfm: </strong>Can you talk a bit about the Black Weirdo parties? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">cat: </strong>Black Weirdo started as house parties that we used to throw in college. Stas and I would always get asked to play some tunes to entertain our friends. We really got into it and once THEESatisfaction started we had a platform to share these experiences of like-mindedness. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">amfm: </strong>What is some music you guys are listening to these days?</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">cat: </strong>I have been listening to a lot full albums from the 90's and early 2000's. Brandy, Usher, Erykah Badu, Lauryn Hill, etc. Also to Tall Black Guy and Count Bass D.</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-958debb9-cbec-fb96-4a68-e6fd1fc59b4a">stas: </strong>Disclosure, James Blake, Wild Cookie, Little Dragon, Haitus Kaiyote, Kelela, Stevie Wonder, ASAP Ferg, Roc Marciano, Gang Starr and Beyonce</p>
