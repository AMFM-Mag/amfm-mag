      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Chantala Komminavanh</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Inspired by the intersection of his Laotion upbringing and history, and urban American culture, particularly hip-hop, Chantala Kommanivanh&rsquo;s pieces are the product of a melding of cultures and an exploration of cultural hybridity. As Chicago native, his most recent work, &lsquo;Like a Zenith&rdquo; is paints a vibrant portrait of the struggle growing up in a diverse city, not void of it&rsquo;s racial and class tensions and issues, Kommanivanh found himself torn between two identities and trying to find his footing. His paintings are bright and full of color and patterns, sometimes juxtaposed next to distorted, sometimes grotesque images of people that give a whole new definition to seeing someone&rsquo;s &lsquo;true colors&rsquo;.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Kommanivanh has received Chicago&rsquo;s Union League Civic &amp; Arts Foundation award and is a UW-Milwaukee two time A.O.P Fellowship award recipient. When he is not making art, he is teaching art at Northeastern Illinois University. He is also a member of the hip-hop duo the Maintenence Crew. His work depicts found images from his family history blended with images with his own personal history outside of the home. Aggressively painted, the strife underlying this exploration of self is apparent in the strokes of his paintbrush, as is his deep love of Wu-Tang.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>Although the new paintings in your new exhibition &quot;Like a Zenith Series&quot; appear vibrant and colorful, you said they come from a dark place and experiences in Chicago, what was the inspiration behind this body of work and why did you choose to tell this story?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">chantala kommanivanh: </strong>Yes. The paintings in the show come from a dark place, a violent place. It is my memories growing up in gangland Chicago in a time where almost every neighborhood was its own warzone under economic instability. Although the imagery in the show doesn&rsquo;t depict a literal scene of bloodshed it depicts the affect around gang violence, class wars, cultures clashing and hood phenomena. The vibrant and colorful palate is my way to attract the viewer as a call for caution, as a call for their attention. Our situation in the city today is a reflection; déjà vu of our past; if we continue to ignore our past then this violence in the Chicago will be pass on generations to come.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>What is the significance of the title?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">kommanivanh: </strong>&ldquo;Like a Zenith...&rdquo; comes from Raekwon the chef in a song titled &ldquo;incarcerated scarefaces&rdquo;, and he said he &ldquo;I seen it like a 27&rdquo; Zenith... Believe it.&rdquo; For many people the violence in Chicago is experienced through media which becomes a filtered reality, it&rsquo;s real and it&rsquo;s not-real. It&rsquo;s only real for those who are exposed to it in real time for those who experience it through a median that reality is surreal. The paintings in the show are like screen shots of a 27&rdquo; Zenith television. It is surreal, it is and it is not, it&rsquo;s both. &ldquo;You got to see it to believe&rdquo; as it says in the company&rsquo;s slogan. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>What is the most significant piece to you in the series and why?<br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">kommanivanh: </strong>The most significant piece in the series to me would be &ldquo;Snow Beach and Spaulding Ave.&rdquo; because I feel like I was one of those kids hanging out with my friends being fly and colorful but at the same time we had the tendency to do damage. Also because I&rsquo;ve gotten so much negative, positive, and confused reactions to it by viewers. Some say the kids are cute, some say why you have them throwing gang signs and some are just confused and bothered by the imagery. The painting speaks differently to the viewer because it&rsquo;s a visual language that has multiple angles for dialog depending on where the viewer comes from in their lives and what they&rsquo;ve experienced in their lives. For me the painting is all of the above.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>A key component of your work is to explore identity, be it your Lao identity, the refugees of your history, dual identity and the media driven culture, why did you feel compelled to make a commentary about these things and how has it appeared and intersected with your work? What have you learned about your own identity and self through your art work?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">kommanivanh: </strong>Being a Lao American artist I think I had a responsibility to participate in the dialog of identity in America because of my own journey to find who I am and speak for those and to those who are in the same struggle. Having lived a dual identity is sort of tricky because I had to find a balance between Lao and American I guess I found that balance through the world of hip hop where I&rsquo;ve participated since a young boy from Albany Park Chicago. Growing up we watched a lot of TV in our home and was heavily influence by what I saw. Also I spent most my childhood outdoors and interacting with people in the streets from all over the world so I was expose to culture at an early age. I didn&rsquo;t grow up with too many Lao friends so I didn&rsquo;t get that Lao education or what it is exactly to be Lao. Hip-hop was that pot where everything came together to become one thing. I had to research my Lao side as an adult because I was never exposed to it besides eating my mom&rsquo;s food which is only 10% of Lao identity. In my work today I portray my identity as Lao and American a hybrid of both.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>You also are a rapper with the Maintenance Crew, is there any overlap with your visual art and musical art?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">kommanivanh: </strong>Yes they do overlap. With music I tend to write about personal events, personal experiences, and even extend conversations I&rsquo;ve had with friends or past relationships. The way I write is also fragmented and abstract, sometimes in songs I don&rsquo;t even rhyme but sonically it makes sense. When I produce beats it&rsquo;s the same way. I sample bits and pieces from multiple recordings from various genres and piece them all together, whether it be a snippet of piano from Ahmad Jamal, a guitar lick from Slash, and a chopped up impeach the president drum snippet as a result we end up with an audio collage when it&rsquo;s all re-arranged in composition. I find my paintings to be the visuals to the music as it shares the same process. I&rsquo;m influenced by many genres of art from graffiti to early renaissance paintings. In terms of imagery I sample from found and personal photographs and re-arrange in some interesting way. The way I see color is the way I hear rhymes over beats, color and brush strokes together become visual rhythm, visual rhyme and reason. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>You describe your painting style as aggressive to disrupt the balance between normalcy and discomfort, can you explain the methodology behind this and why you choose to depict people and their figures in a crude manner?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">kommanivanh:</strong> My paintings appear to be normal, safe,and inviting through color balance and vibrancy but I think the discomfort comes in with the brush strokes, mark makings the way I handle the paint, it&rsquo;s very loose. In some paintings normalcy comes from the figures that I paint, the children. Children can appear to be safe, loving, and comforting but that&rsquo;s the outside. I try to paint from the internal where beauty lies and that is the discomfort side, the ugly, the history, the mystery. Happy people are boring; no one ever smiles in my paintings. I hate happy people they are deceiving beings.<br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">amfm: </strong>What is your earliest childhood art memory?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-9195c06f-1781-69fd-e901-569719f12e0b">kommanivanh:</strong> My first childhood art memory would be me admiring my brother&rsquo;s drawings as a kid. They would draw me pictures or I would see them drawing and I would then try and mimic it or sometimes I would trace it against the window then modifying it as my own. I think I was like 3 or 4.
