      <p><strong>      Kirk Knight: Metro Chicago</strong> </p>
      <p dir="ltr">New York rapper, Kirk Knight was blessed with a very Chicago welcome at his headlining show at Metro. Some of Chicago&rsquo;s most esteemed emcees took to the stage to deliver one of the most turnt shows to date I&rsquo;ve personally have ever been to, and quite possibly the earliest timewise to be so hype. Metro graced the kiddos with a 17 and up show which kicked off at 6 o&rsquo;clock, and was easily five hours. Just when you thought it would die down DJ Oreo would hit em&rsquo; with another banger or a surprise guest would appear.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/roy.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="roy" /><br />
      <span class="content"><em>(pictured above: Roy French and Jinx of Drip Gang)</em></span>      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Opening the show was a slew of local, up and coming Chicago cats, including Logan Cage, who certainly was &ldquo;flexin on his exes&rdquo; up on that stage, along with Roy French and Jinx and the rest of the Drip Gang Crew who crowdsurfed through waves of fans who repeated &ldquo;I cannot save a hoe.&rdquo; From drowning, or themselves, not really sure, but does that really matter when the energy is decibels higher than a hoe can simply take?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/supa.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="supa" /><br />
        <span class="content"><em>(pictured above: Supa Bwe of Hurt Everybody)</em></span>        <br />
        <br />
      There was high anticipation for the trio, Supa Bwe, Carl and Mulatto of Hurt Everybody, who has been steadily rising to stardom with show after show. They&rsquo;ve got the conscious lyrics and commentary on their side with their songs about heroism, the ills and stresses of society, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m black, everyday is my funeral&rdquo; being one of them, and the turn up, with songs set over ringtones and their popular anthem &ldquo;Social Network (Gang).&rdquo; Throughout the show they would playfully address the crowd about El Chapo, or life anecdotes and nuggets of knowledge, &ldquo;We can grow separately, but we gotta grow together,&rdquo; Carl told the crowd. They played the show like three kings, with beams of light glistening over their backs, smiles on their faces, and a crowd invested in the sound.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/allanking.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="allankingdom" /><br />
      <span class="content"><em>(pictured above: Allan Kingdom)</em></span>      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Minnesota Grammy nominated rapper, Allan Kingdom, aka the Peanut Butter Prince took the stage and graced the crowd with a beautiful set. He even brought out some of his kinfolk, Milwaukee&rsquo;s Webster X, who had performed the night before at a Wisconsin Music Showcase, and Chicago&rsquo;s Cloud Sessions&rsquo; Alex Wiley, who played later that evening as well. It was a mixture of moshing and glory as he had the venue bring down the lights and have everyone light up the space with their phones during &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Take No Favors,&rdquo; which had the feel of hundred of Chinese lanterns. He even did a cover of Kanye West&rsquo;s &ldquo;All Day.&rdquo;</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/saba.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="saba" /><br />
      <span class="content"><em>(pictured above: Saba)</em></span></p>
      <p dir="ltr">DJ Oreo played what could be viewed as a musical intermission. Concert, imma let you finish, but DJ Oreo played the most turnt set of all time that evening. Other cameos included Daley, activist, poet and emcee, Malcolm London, who took the stage for the first time since his heinous arrest at a protest, Saba, and the water God, Mick Jenkins, who had played the Metro just weeks before.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/malcom.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="malcom" /><br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Headliner, Kirk Knight, came out all smiles as he delved into the set featuring songs from his debut album <em>Late Knight Special, </em>asking the crowd, &ldquo;What the f*ck you know about the nighttime?&rdquo; a play on the words of his name and his song &quot;One Knight.&quot; Apparently the crowd who was quite young didn&rsquo;t know much about the nighttime, or they had exhausted all of their energy on the sea of performers prior, because Knight mentioned in his set on more than one occasion how Chicago wasn&rsquo;t showing him love. It definitely had to be the latter, because Knight is definitey one of the artists and producers to watch currently with his experiemental hip hop infused with jazz and afrofuturist vibes. By the end of the show, he had won their hearts and their ears and he said he would love to come back. At an early, 9:45 pm, the crowd spilled out of the venue, fully charged and ready for the late night special.</p>
