      <p><strong>The Sound of Assembly: Ataxia and Secrets</strong></p>
      <p>Detroit is known for it&rsquo;s rich automotive history and musical roots. When Motor City meets Techno City magic happens. Paxahau and Ford fused the two concepts together for a special project for Movement called &ldquo;The Sound of Assembly,&rdquo;with two locally bred Detroit electronic musicians.</p>
      <p>Detroit DJs Ataxia and Secrets came together and explored the Ford warehouse for a day, taking sounds of manufacturing, the humming, the drilling and mechanics of the Ford electric car and composed them into their music which debuted at the festival. Listeners may have very well suffered from ataxia, a condition that causes a temporary loss of muscle control at Movement because no one could not stop moving at their set. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">amfm: </strong>How did this project come to be?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ford:</strong> Ford and Paxahau have a had agreat relationship over the last 3 years that we both wanted to expand on. When we discussed what would be fun and organic to the industry we thought about how electronic music, in some ways, was born out of Detroit and from &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; inspirations. From there, we figured getting some talented artists from Detroit involved would allow us all to create something very unique.<strong><br />
      </strong>      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>secrets: </strong>I got asked a couple weeks ago from the guys at paxahau to get involved with the project and it sounded like a lot of fun. When you trace back the music of the city it all goes back to like the motown, and a lot of music, especially electronic. To actually get into the assembly and sample the sounds and be inspired to make electronic music was a really awesome thing to be able to be a part of.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ataxia: </strong>The idea sounded really cool and we were stoked to be a part of it. It was very eye opening to kind of see the machines in motion and hear the heavy reverb in the warehouses, it really mimicked the music that we fell in love with in the 90&rsquo;s with techno and minimal. You can definitely see where some of the pioneers of the music were taking influence especially being detroit techno and it being motor city and the synergy between Detroit&rsquo;s automotive and techno origins.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">amfm: </strong>How does the project blend old school manufacturing with modern music making?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ford: </strong>The assembly plant was born by Ford in Detroit decades ago, and it is still the process automotive companies use to put the world on wheels. We took artists Ataxia and Secrets into our Michigan Assembly Plant which builds the Ford Focus and allowed them to record samples of the assembly line. Although our assembly plant is completely modernized, it is a technique and an operation that has been utilized and refined for years. Ataxia and Secrets then took the samples of the building of the Focus and turned them into new tracks which they will premier for the first time at Movement.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">amfm: </strong>Why did Ford want to pay homage to Detroit's automotive history through electronic music? </p>
      f<strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ord: </strong>Detroit&rsquo;s heritage is very important to Ford, and we know that the city&rsquo;s history and impact stretches farther than the automotive industry. This is an opportunity for us to collaborate with a couple exciting artists and have them tell our story through their creative lenses. When we have the opportunity to connect with people in an arena that they love…and its organic…that is the best way for us to tell our story. <strong><br />
      </strong>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>Were there any sounds in particular that inspired you? was it a difficult process?</p>
      <strong>ataxia: </strong>The sounds that really caught our attention were the sounds of the power drill stamping the VIN number into the motors. It sounded very cool, kind of like industrial construction and it was very rattly and we used that in our tune. Also the sirens that were in the stamping warehouse were really alarming and very intense and you could tell there were elements of danger and it was definitely and intense environment to capture recordings. We used the sirens in the song so it kind of creates this element of emergency I think. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">secrets: </strong>I liked a lot of the compression noises and the echoing effect in the warehouse. I&rsquo;ve never been in a place that large before, let alone a single warehouse. The people talking in the background and the echoing were some things that I tried to work into my track to give people a gauge of what these places really are. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">amfm: </strong>what is the electronic/techno scene like in Detroit? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ataxia: </strong>I&rsquo;ve been going to parties in Detroit since I was like 15 years old, and have been a promoter since i was 16, so I would say that it&rsquo;s been a never ending work in progress and Detroit is definitely a scene that continues to rebuild and revamp itself with new key players. There really are a lot of people that have stayed here that are really big participants in the scene and help make parties happen<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">secrets: </strong>It&rsquo;s a labor of love. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ataxia: </strong>We really do it to continue to grow our culture instead of allowing it to shrink. People need to be good stewards of their local music community. Another great thing that&rsquo;s happening is that there are a number of up and coming younger crews and they&rsquo;re starting to rise up, and it&rsquo;s great to see.  <strong><br />
      </strong>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>What do you guys love about Detroit?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">secrets: </strong>I am a huge believer in the focus on the creative art both in visual, audio and any kind of experiential art that people create in Detroit that is very DIY. Most of the things that happen in Detroit are independent, they&rsquo;re underground, theyre done by people who don&rsquo;t have a budget behind something. They&rsquo;re just creating it and setting it up to help improve our standing and culture. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-0ff8d5fa-40f9-1959-7f09-c6cd135218fb">ataxia: </strong>There&rsquo;s so many things I love about this city, it&rsquo;s so artistically driven. I think more than anything is my favorite thing about this city. It&rsquo;s a small community, whether you&rsquo;re in the rock scene, or the electronic scene, everyone kind of knows each other and looks out for eachother and there&rsquo;s no rivalry, everyone sort of helps each other out. The thing about Detroit is that it&rsquo;s been through a lot of hard times, but I think the best art comes through pain and suffering.
