/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

The song, &quot;UMOJA&quot;  is a tribute to the first day of Kwanzaa, which  strives  to maintain unity in the family, community, nation, and race. This song does just that, with it's catchy hook, and signature Calid B cadence, and he says. &quot;we've got something in common,&quot; and its great drums and interlaced with beats, and &quot;afro-hyphy&quot; vibes, which were also produced by him.</p>

Nasty in fact. But nasty in the best way possible. Her art illustrates the mind of a woman of tapping into her power and prowess.

Emma Mckee, better known as The Stitch Gawd, knows this all too well, so it&rsquo;s no mistake that she found herself in immersed in Chicago&rsquo;s Hip-Hop scene far from her hometown in Tulsa, Oklahoma after her stint in Canada had come to an abrupt ending. It&rsquo;s also no mistake that she found solace in the music scene and found herself rubbing elbows and thus embroidering the backs for some of Chicago&rsquo;s finest artists like Chance The Rapper. </p>
