      <p><strong>Pitchfork Sunday</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Sunday at Pitchfork for us was definitely a sonic journey. This was quite possibly the best day of the fest, scattered with such random acts that would have never been paired together otherwise. You had Sun Ra Arkestra opening up the day, followed by the local ladies of HOMME, the classical mastery of Kamasi Washington, eclectic funky flair of Thundercat, and R&amp;B artists Miguel and Jeremih, all of this leading up to the lady of the hour, headliner, FKA Twigs.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/pitchforkdrugs.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="pitchfork" /></p>
      <p dir="ltr">A day where you have Kamasi Washington and Thundercat within any musical range of one another is bound to be a sound sensory overload, think back to <em>The Epic</em> last year. There is something special about Thundercat and the way that he executes his music. There is a certain magic in his fingers as he flicks the strings of his bass in such a quick and meticulous way with this passion written all over his face. Known for his over the top headdresses, he was a bit more subdued - can&rsquo;t exactly wear an animal on your head in 90 degree weather. He has a strong stage presence, and whether you are familiar with his music or not, it&rsquo;s hard not to appreciate the true artistry behind his music and execution. He, like Washington, has collaborated with some amazing musicians like Kendrick Lamar, Erykah Badu, and Flying Lotus.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">Chicago&rsquo;s R&amp;B sweetheart Jeremih graced the stage on his birthday and had the whole crowd saying &ldquo;oui.&rdquo; He was all about the audience participation, asking the crowd, which Jeremih they wanted to hear, and it was a journey through time and classics that I didn&rsquo;t even know were classics. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I heard &ldquo;Down On Me,&rdquo; his song with 50 Cent, or &ldquo;Birthday Sex,&rdquo; which hopefully he indulged in later that night, perhaps to his sexy hit &ldquo;F*ck You All the Time.&rdquo; He had lady stage dancers, hype men, and surprised the crowd by bringing out everyone&rsquo;s hometown favorite Chance The Rapper, who headlined the fest last year. Chance stole the show a bit coming off the high of his Coloring Book Mixtape; however, it was a nice treat.</p>

      <p dir="ltr">We caught a bit of Miguel&rsquo;s performance before heading for the big Twigs production. He performed until he was drenched in sweat in an all white ensemble, giving a whole new meaning to the wet t-shirt contest. Women were swooning, his smile was winning, his voice was as smooth as butter and when he asked if people liked drugs they responded appropriately because it was highly likely that they were. To his right on the green stage, they were setting up for FKA Twigs, silhouettes of hands from her set were illuminated by the sunset, and set the tone for the mystical experience that was about to ensue.      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">FKA Twigs didn&rsquo;t say much during her set, and she didn&rsquo;t need to. Her voice soft and humble, her singing bold and beckoning, captivated the audience. The entire concert experience was other worldly. FKA Twigs is something out of this world. It was our fourth time at a Twigs show, and by far this one had the most production value, and was the best display of her evolution as an artist. The show had a full on storyline, full of interpretive dancers, bodies, and higher dimensional undertones. Twigs emerged with blonde dreadlocked hair, with what appeared to be a small feather bow through her nostrils on a quest for a &ldquo;magic crystal&rdquo; with her tribe.<br />

      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Each song flowed into the other seamlessly and effortlessly as she weaved together a medley of songs from LP1 like &ldquo;Two Weeks,&rdquo; her deliriously beautiful &ldquo;Water Me&rdquo; and M3L155X&rsquo;s Glass &amp; Patron, and a couple of new songs with a jungle vibe. Words don&rsquo;t best describe the experience it was; It was art come to life to say the least and the perfect peaceful closing reflection of the Pitchfork weekend.      [ciera mckissick]</p>
