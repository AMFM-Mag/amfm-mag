      <p><strong>Ace Da Vinci</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Ace Da Vinci makes music to get high to. All drugs aside, despite the fact that his album &ldquo;SEVENDAYHIGH&rdquo; comes out on the popular stoner holiday 4/20, the music itself will leave you with an everlasting feeling that will take you through the motions of being hype, chill, inspired and motivated from his wide range of talented bars and knowledge dropped. Music can be a drug too, and Ace leaves you begging for more.<br />
        <br />
There is a certain artistry behind his craft. This Chicago rapper is much more than that. he writes his own music, produces his own beats, is nothing short of a poet, an activist and leader. God Bless his talent, and him for sharing it with the masses and his community. Ace Da Vinci it&rsquo;s nice to meet you. He is definitely a man on his hustle having started on his own, to building his crew, SmartMouf, and building a wide following locally and soon much much more. He&rsquo;s already hit the airwaves, and there is only up from here. As he says in his song &ldquo;Boy Meets World,&rdquo; he is definitely about to be a star.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: </strong>You said you've been writing since the third grade and that you were born into music, when did you decide that you wanted to pursue your dreams of being a rapper?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci: </strong>I&rsquo;ve always been a writer, but the inspiration to put a musical sound to my writings happened during high school. I didn't take my passion seriously until I graduated.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: </strong>You describe your work as an audio journal, how is making music a cathartic experience for you? What are some particular songs that were pivotal experiences or emotional renderings for you?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci: </strong>There was a period in my life where I felt as if I had no one to connect with. Having that lack of communication with peers, I turned to my writings as a way to build understanding of both myself and volatile situations. That's why it&rsquo;s an audio journal. Pivotal songs that brewed from the purest emotions would be tracks like &ldquo;The Traveler,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Move&rdquo; and &ldquo;God Bless.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: </strong>You recently had your song &quot;God Bless&quot; play on WGCI and are working on a new album 'Seven Day High,&quot; why is the song &quot;God Bless&quot; one that sticks out or holds meaning to you? What is the album like?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci: </strong>&quot;God Bless&quot; was created during a time of great distress. My family and I were going through foreclosure and losing our childhood home, so it was imperative I created something that served as a positive outlook on what was to come. SEVENDAYHIGH is a journey of emotions, perspectives, and moods. No two days are alike, and neither are the sounds on the project. It&rsquo;s all about balance, and it drops on 4/20 [today].<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: </strong>How has Chicago helped mold you as a person, an artist and shaped your music?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci:</strong> I grew up throughout different parts of the city. Chicago provides a mentality that enables you to be passionate enough to help your fellow man, and detached enough to focus on self when the time fits.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: </strong>You make all of your own beats and created a crew SmartMouf, what does SmartMouf stand for?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci:</strong> SmartMouf is a lifestyle. We consist of music artists, dancers and poets. As we're all from different walks of life, we all pull inspiration from outside elements and, most importantly, from each other.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: </strong>You are quite involved in the peaceful protests for &quot;black lives matter&quot; why is this important to you and how does it affect you and spill over into your music?<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci: </strong>I feel as if I wouldn't be playing my part as a man if I did not visibly stand up for what I believed in. I know there is oftentimes a disconnect between the &quot;activist&quot; and the &quot;average black person,&quot; but there is no distinction. Someone has to come out here and voice the opinion of our people. Someone has to lead by example. Might as well be me.<br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">amfm: What is the significance of your name Ace Da Vinci?</strong></p>
<p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-18ea4171-d03b-0719-050f-0d15035e6aad">ace da vinci: </strong>Ace da Vinci, simply put, is the Artist Who Drew Himself. I didn't really have a musical big brother to tell me what to do right or wrong in this scene. I felt everything myself and created what I needed to for me and the people I want to support. My biggest thing in life is showing my loved ones how real this success can be for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;God Bless&quot;</strong>
