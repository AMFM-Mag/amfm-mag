      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Carlos &quot;Dzine&quot; </strong><strong id="docs-internal-guid-564eeb36-0569-b5a2-e485-717134e36c45">Rolón</strong>      </p>
      <p>Carlos Rolón, known by his street name, Dzine, is a connoisseur of the customization of street culture. His grand displays and site specific sculptural installations and conceptual art pieces have traversed the globe, from lowrider bicycles adorned with gold and garb, to painted Rolls Royces decked out with subwoofers, elaborate nail art, vibrant mandalas and homages to his childhood growing up Puerto Rican in Chicago. His playful, yet solemn and reflective approach to his work is an example of what happens when pop culture and high art collide. </p>
      <p>The beauty behind Dzine, is his use of his own life as a point of exploration, whether it be through replicas of literal objects that graced the mantles and walls of his home growing up and the stories behind those objects, or his desire to comment on what we deem as beautiful and the inclusivity of the art world. Wrapped in ritual and spiritualism, embedded in culture, and splashed with color, Dzine creates a world of reimagined urban artifacts that are timeless.      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
      <strong>amfm:</strong> You spoke about your early beginnings or growing up feeling like the art world wasn’t always inviting. Did you not see yourself there? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>carlos rolón:</strong> It’s never felt that way to me. What was made clear is that as a young aspiring artist I don’t remember seeing work in the institutions that spoke to me on a personal level or that had a story that was connected to my environment. Growing up admiring works from old masters to contemporaries is always inspiring and it’s always wonderful to learn new ideas, but it’s also important to me that art feel inclusive. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> Thus, your work deals a lot with this mentality of bringing some semblance of normalcy or "hood" culture into the high art world. Why did you begin your work ideology with this notion? How have you successfully juxtaposed the two and why did you see a need to do so?      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón: </strong>What is perceived as hood I perceive as culture, which in turn deals with identity. I became interested in the idea of custom culture through a short film I made for a show at the Brooklyn Museum years back. The film focused on Benjy Melendez. Benjy started one of the first gangs in New York called<em> The Ghetto Brothers</em>, which eventually turned into a club dealing with social and political issues. When I made this film, I needed another medium to tell his story visually. After some research, I found that one of Benjy’s main modes of transportation was a bicycle, which in turn, gave me the idea to produce a bicycle sculpture to be part of this story. The concept of a custom vehicle is also closely related to Lowriding culture, which I also find fascinating. I’m interested how Benjy’s story and lowriding culture relate to cultural identity and community. Some of these clubs have amazingly beautiful hand crafted custom jackets to be proudly worn and displayed. It’s interesting how people can share a common idea to express their identity. This led me to explore other custom cultures, the language, art and craft making that comes from within. Creatively, this genres defies race, gender, age and financial status; however, the work that is created sometimes comments about these very issues, so it’s a paradox. I found that some of these people are investing their savings to create custom parts with gold plating, engraving and custom fabric   at times, for things no one will ever see. I love the psychology behind this. It’s about the work. Most importantly, what these people have is what some fine artists lack - passion. The passion behind their creations reminds me why I create and why I decided to become an artist. If Frank Ghery or Tadao Endo designed a vehicle or functional sculpture, it’s immediately widely accepted by a museum curator. Which has led me to another reason why I make this particular work. It is to question stereotypes, cultural issues, and make people think about their place and status in society. Lastly, I love creating these beautiful objects that are excessive, slightly obnoxious and in fact somewhat ridiculous. Although I have great memories as a child, I didn’t grow up privileged, so I feel as if I’m creating somewhat of a fantastical and magical world of things I could never attain.        </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>What is an urban artifact to you,  and why have you chosen to play homage to them in your work? What has been your favorite representation of this?        </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón: </strong>An object that people walk past everyday and never consider it as a work of art. I like the concept of taking an ordinary object or objects, creating a new hybrid work that reveals something magical or have the inert ability to have people view it differently. I think my bicycle sculptures are a good representation. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> Your family and your upbringing have a heavy influence on your work, from the replica of the living room, to the chandeliers, and knock off fine china you have recreated in a very regal way. You talk about this intimate experience, especially with the story behind behind the urns or china containers around your home that hid your father's alcoholism. Are these pieces you make cathartic or therapeutic art?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> <strong>rolón: </strong>I think all art should be cathartic or therapeutic in some way. If the work has a story or lineage, and is created in an honest way, the work will speak for itself.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> How is it for you to have people interact with the intimate pieces of your childhood coming at it as an art bystander? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón: </strong>The work dealing with my childhood are usually installation based or very site specific. I feel the reason these works are so successful is that they feel familiar. The stories behind these works are genuine. The items are tactile and people are allowed to interact with the environment. It sparks conversation and this is what’s important. It creates a bond between people who otherwise would probably never meet. My work also crosses into pop culture, which I like, because the audience is now expanded. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> You said your strong Puerto Rican identity was instilled at a young age, but that it made you question identity and your surroundings. Why? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón: </strong>I clearly remember my 6th grade science teacher telling me I was American as I kept trying to explain to her that both of my parents were of Puerto Rican descent. She kept telling me I’m American, loudly and aggressively in front of the whole class. We kept going back and forth. I went home crying. I also had a green machine bicycle, my father played Salsa music very loud when he was working in the garage, and the Pope visited our neighborhood when I was young. One of my fondest memories was my first trophy, earning arrows and stripes in boy scouts. My house had Christmas garland all year round. We have mirror, venetian, striped and floral wallpaper in various rooms in our house. My father had Jim Beam, animals, cars and beautiful ornate porcelain decanters that, as a youth, served as my introduction to sculpture. I learned about jazz music through Charlie Brown and sexual flirtation through Benny Hill. My point is, I think every artist has a memory, personal or distant relationship that plays a role within their work.        </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> What kinds of questions did a young Carlos ask and what did you discover? How has this translated into your work as an artist? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón:  </strong>I’m always asking how and why. I’ve always been genuinely curious. You have to be willing to take the work all way to the left. Sometimes you’ll get killed for it. Sometimes you’ll succeed. It has allowed me to be a multi-faceted artist. Creating works with various materials with ideas that can result in hybrid objects and paintings </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> You said you discovered art on your own at a very young age. Can you speak a bit on that discovery? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón:</strong> Looking at my work now, I was surrounded by ideas all my life. I just never had the clarity to see this. I do now. Officially discovering an art movement was when I was 13. I saw a movie called<em> Style Wars</em> on PBS. Aside from discovering the Graffiti movement, I also discovered Hip Hop Culture. Which led me to investigate the NYC culture of the 60’s and 70’s, the East Village scene from Punk to Disco, CBGB’s, Mudd Club, etc. Books like “Art After Midnight” by Steven Hager, and reading about artists like John Fekner, Jean Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, The Clash, Jenny Holzer and Eva Hesse. Gallerists like Tony Shafrazi, Annina Nosei and curators Achille Bonito Oliva and Richard D. Marshall. It allowed me to be a free thinker. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> You seem to have a fascination with mandalas? Why are you drawn to them and how does their spirituality or ritual have a role in your work?        </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón:</strong> It is very important to have balance. In general, my studio practice is very multi-faceted; however, when you see the work together in a closed environment, it completely makes sense. There is a harmonious thread throughout the work. I embrace the idea of craft making and the history and lineage it represents. The Mandala paintings are an extension of this. Influenced by traditional craft making, fabric doilies, bobbin lace, etc. There’s something very honest, technical and somewhat therapeutic about the mandala paintings, even with my chandelier sculptures. These are entirely craft based with the use of vintage crystals and car audio speakers - some playing Buddhist Om chants. They’re strangely seamless embracing the concept of oneness. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> Do you follow any sort of ritual when you are making art or processing your pieces? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>rolón:</strong> When I walk into the studio, I light incense throughout. I catch up on emails and usually play Philip Glass, Cinematic Orchestra, Miles Davis, Classical, something that allows me to think. Then my crew in the main part of the studio will have on NPR and other various music. I like my studio clean and organized. A clean studio is an efficient studio; however, It can get hard to keep things organized when we’re working on a large show. But it’s ok, this is the spirit of the flow. After a big show or project, we give the studio a good cleaning and re-organize our tools and materials. I even paint the floors and walls to give the space new energy. It allows for a new start and new ideas. To move on from what was. <br />
