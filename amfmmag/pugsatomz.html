      <p><strong>Pugs Atomz</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Having started his own label, Birthrite Records, forming the crew Nacrobats, co-hosting the longstanding <a href="http://whpk.org/shows/rap/">CTA Radio show</a> with KMax on WPHK, and sitting as Creative Director of Iridium Clothing, Pugs Atomz is a veteran in the Chicago hip hop scene. Originally hailing from Pittsburgh and moving to Englewood in Chicago with his mother, an artist and his father, Vincent Price a popular radio show host, Pugs was creatively charged at a young age and destined for greatness. Inspired by his new surroundings, the hustle and bustle, the trains, graffiti and street culture, he wrote his first &ldquo;rap&rdquo; in the 5th grade.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">He later attended School of the Art Institute of Chicago and majored in painting and video production, and has since evolved to traveling sharing his music with the world. Pugs fueled the inspiration he gathered around the globe, not only in the music scene, but in the underground street scene and fashion playing alongside<a href="http://www.djvadim.com/"> DJ Vadim</a>. His music is an ode to the city that made him, and he is definitely a rapper spitting conscious lyrics. Coming fresh off of his newest EP release, <em>Nouveau Casino</em>, Pugs has still got that fire. He is definitely more than &ldquo;kinda like a rapper.&rdquo;<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm: </strong>When your family moved to Chicago from Pittsburgh, that was when you really became interested in hip-hop, what kind of music were you exposed to growing up or listening to before hand? What  Chicago spoke to your young soul?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs atomz: </strong>Well my dad was a radio DJ and moved to Chicago to be on WVON. My mom was a painter. He would always play me the new stuff all of the time, and still til this day will send me music or a good read. I remember him playing me Prince, Paul Simon, Bob Marley blues and jazz. My great Aunt always played Willie Nelson to me. My first record I bought was a 45 by The Jets and I was also into Michael Jackson and a lot of R&amp;B. My uncles from Jamaica had me recording reggae mixes from the college stations which got me into finding rap shows on the radio. I just felt a connection to the controlled chaos of graffiti that was on and around the trains in Chicago then. Also the trains symbolized freedom from my surroundings growing up in Englewood. It was changing, and my outlook was getting bigger. The performers on the trains, as well as my cousins, made it seem real to be a rapper, because honestly in my younger years I didn't relate to rap.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm:</strong> It seems some people already deemed you a rapper before you even did, from people at the radio stations you used to deliver to asking if you were a rapper, as far back as grade school writing a poem and the class saying you were rapping instead. When did you get into rapping?&nbsp;You also went to school for painting and video production at SAIC, right?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs: </strong>My mom always had me in art classes, painting and sketching at home. Her paintings and artist friends really motivated me to follow my passion. I wanted to be an artist more so, a painter that did a lot of graffiti, but for a week when I was like 13 it was a quick possibility. I think I made two songs on my keyboard with the terrible preset drums. A few years later in high school, I would always get rhymed at assuming I was a MC, and finally the one day I responded in a off the top freestyle and it went over well. That is when it started to seem like a possibility. As soon as I found out freshman year in college that SAIC had a recording studio, I was focused on it. I design my own album covers edit my own videos.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm: </strong>You spent quite a lot of time overseas on tour with DJ Vadim doing projects with him, The Electrics, and now you are back to Chicago. How did those travels and musical experiences help your own personal music endeavors evolve? How are you getting back into your roots now being back?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs: </strong>The travel really changed the way I saw The US and how other countries see us. Performing in so many places where English isn't the secondary language. I really started to make songs that if you didn't know English well, you could still follow and sing along with my story. It pushed me to take music seriously and be more business minded. It pushed me to try new approaches hearing all these new sounds, and to have fun when you can. Vadim would always say &lsquo;this could be the best that it gets enjoy it.&rsquo; Even though it kept getting bigger and better. Getting back to Chicago was a lot of catching up to new and old friends and entering the new landscape of the scenes. My first show back was at the Park West and it felt good to be home. CTA radio was exactly how I left it, but I felt something was missing. I got back into designing and became the Creative Director at <a href="https://iridiumclothingco.com/">Iridium</a>. For the most, part being back reminded &nbsp;me of the struggle and how far I've gone since those milk crate basketball in the alley days. I think the biggest thing was the shift from hip-hop to drill and bop music dominating Chicago and our reputation.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm: </strong>How did you get into doing CTA Radio for  over a decade? Why was this an endeavor that you wanted to pursue? <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs: </strong>I had been studying these shows on FM and AM, big and little unconsciously by tapping these shows to have new music to listen to each week. When My friend Raina brought us up there to freestyle over that <em>Bahamadia</em> record, it was a moment for us to do it live and tell our story. At this time there's no YouTube, Twitter, or rap blog, just magazines, vhs tapes, and word of mouth. As far as hosting the show, it felt like home, I had already been there so many times to service records, freestyle &nbsp;play my stuff and what not. I felt me and my friends could be a voice to champion great music, MC's producers etc...From Chicago and the underground. I have always been one to say start it now figure it out later. It paid off as well, I got a record deal to put out a Chicago rap compilation on Raptivism Records that featured a buzzing Lupe Fiasco, Common, Abstract Mindstate among others.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm: </strong>Had you always had an interest in radio since your dad was also in radio growing up? Did you ever sit in in the studio with him as a kid or pop up on air back then?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs:</strong> I always thought of it as a possibility as that was my dad&rsquo;s first job in my eyes. The one thing I do remember was always wanting to take the gold Chaka Khan record out the frame he had gotten from her label.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm: </strong>You once said, clothing stores have become what record stores used to be. Do you think music and fashion naturally go hand in hand?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs: </strong>I think clothing stores are the same feel as the mom and pop record stores of the past. You&rsquo;re selling to your peers family and new friends. Your business is your story. Music has lost value because of the freeness of the internet. You can't download a cool hat or t shirt. Also people have moved away from big brands and want to stand out.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">amfm: </strong>You said you always knew you wanted to enter the fashion realm? How did you get linked up with or approached to be the Creative Director of Iridium, and why was this ultimately something you wanted to pursue?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d288b44f-975e-3239-c119-916ff20cd1e8">pugs: </strong>My mom was a buyer at the Merchandise Mart, and my grandma had me working in her thrift stores, so I always was around clothing. In my teens, I started to collect new and vintage Polo and really studied the brand, to the point that I started to sell the pieces I was buying to other kids - Nautica, Gap, Eddie Bauer, Champion also, because kids in the hood didn't know where to go, similar to that scene in City of God. In college, I designed for a brand called Black Pea, then my roommate taught me how to paint t-shirts, then I interned with Afro Wear and really got my feet wet with their work with American Needle. But throughout that I would make my own t-shirts and promo shirts for my music and crew. I linked with Iridium first as my sponsor. Platinum would hook me up with pieces for my tours. When I moved back to Chi, we got to talking and I showed him some designs, and I shot and edited a video lookbook for the brand. From there I got more and more involved and became the Creative Director. My role is creating clothing, content, shaping how people see the brand and store. Creating new partnerships, internships, public speaking, really all things creative from logos to videos. I just felt it was a brand where I can be as creative as I wanted, from big ideas to crazy designs. For the most part, anything is possible, as we have proven in the last few years.<br />
