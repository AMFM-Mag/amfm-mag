      <p><strong>Sylvan Esso</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Sylvan Esso is the love child of the folk meets electronic duo Nicholas Sanborn and Amelia Randall Meath. The two met over music and a dance floor, and what was supposed be a musical one night stand became a match made in heaven. Sanborn formerly of Megafaun, remixed &ldquo;Play it Right,&rdquo; Meath&rsquo;s song with her former band Mountain Man. With Meath&rsquo;s breathy vocals and lilting lyrics over Sanborn&rsquo;s sultry, deep bass influenced production, the two have been making a rumble in the indie music arena with their debut song &ldquo;Coffee&rdquo; and self titled EP. </p>      
      <p>Their music is fun and carefree with a slight hint of melancholia in a way that it seeps into your soul, or perhaps it is the wiles of Heath. There&rsquo;s something special about music duos, especially male-female ones. There appears to be something musically intimate when two people form a partnership and feel off of each other and share this &quot;musical space&quot; and emotion. Heath is willowly and chic and Sanborn is gritty with a Midwestern charm, as he hails from Milwaukee. </p>
      <p>Sylvan Esso is heading to the Midwest on their upcoming tour, making a stop in Chicago to play at <a href="http://metrochicago.com/" target="_blank">The Metro</a>. Make sure to catch our review of their <a href="http://metrochicago.com/sylvan-esso-03-14-15/" target="_blank">Chicago show</a> in a few weeks. <br />

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amfm: </strong>You guys both have different backgrounds, Amelia, you in folk from your previous band, and Nick, you in electronic. How did the two of you get into making music individually?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amelia: </strong>Nick was taught how to play bass by Cal Mazzara in high school in Madison Wisconsin. I learned how to sing after dinner around the table while I was growing up. Music was always the main interest for both of us!
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amfm: </strong>You guys ended up on a bill together which was how you guys met and began working together after. What was that initial thing that drew you to one another? When was Sylvan Esso conceptualized?</p>
<strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amelia: </strong>We knew we were friends because we dance in the same way. Sylvan esso was conceptualized at Ella's Deli in Madison, where we decided we should make more tracks together. We wrote over email for a bit, then decided we should live closer. Thus, SE was born! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amfm: </strong>I've always been particularly interested in musical duos. What is your dynamic like together?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amelia: </strong>Kinda like a father and his estranged son sharing a tiny submersible. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amfm: </strong>You guys actually met at The Cactus Club in Milwaukee and Nick is from Milwaukee too. Amelia, what has Nick told you about Milwaukee if anything? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amelia: </strong>I always look forward to the motherfucking Cactus Club!!!!!!! And Bloody Mary's and Pony Chasers at The Palomino where Nick used to work door, when it was all tots all the time. Milwaukee shaped Nick like any place that you grow up in. He feels like a tree in the right soil when he visits. It should also be noted that at the first Burnhearts PBR Fest Nick worked security, which is a joke in itself... </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amfm: </strong>You guys just released your first self-titled album, and it's been really well received, how has the momentum been? What are some things you love about the album? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amelia: </strong>The momentum is moving like momentum does. It feels great! We feel like the the album is about finding the joy in the mundane, pedestrian parts of life. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amfm:</strong> How do you like your coffee? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">nick: </strong>Black. Hot when it's not. Cold when it's hot. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-78be99e1-cbdb-20bf-c1f6-db8abfab5e74">amelia: </strong>The same, but with milk. <br />
