      <p><strong>Highness</strong></p>
      <p>Highness brings a sense of royalty to the stage when they preform. Perhaps it is because the five-piece band is composed of all women, or that they are all stand alone artists in their own rights, or because they make conscious music that pushes boundaries and begs the question. The collective is composed of Gem Tree (on vocals), Loona Dae (on vocals), Schenay Mosely (on vocals and keyboard), Red (on drums), and Ora (on guitar), and together they meld together a sound that is hip-hop infused with soul, funk, a bit of punk and jazz with a radical feeling that makes you want to throw your fist in the air in solidarity. </p>
      <p>They recently released their debut EP <em>Young Taboo</em>, which is an eclectic example of who they are as artists and what they individually bring to the table and fuse together. It’s rare to find an all-girl group these days that makes power infused music. This isn’t your typical girl power movement; it is a people movement. When asked why they choose to address taboo topics, they said, “it’s how we live. It’s what we live.”<br />
      </p>
<p><strong>amfm: </strong>How long have you been playing drums Red?</p>
      <p><strong>red:</strong> Since I was born, naw I was eight. My family, they do the whole thing. Don’t say you wanna play an instrument, they’ll be on you, shove it down your throat! I said it once, and that’s what happened. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did you guys kind of get into making music, how long have you been doing it and how did you come together as a group?</p>
      <p><strong>ora: </strong>Gem Tree found me in the hallway. She knew a mutual friend of ours and someone told her that I played, and she was like would you like to play in a band? And I was like oh emm gee, totally! I knew she was legit because we started talking about neo-soul, and that was like the hip new word. Everyone was like “neo-soul,” “neo-soul,” and I would look at them like, what’s neo-soul? And they would be like ohhh you know, it’s like soul, and no one had a straight answer, but she was the only one who had a straight answer. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What would you say neo-soul is? </p>
      <p><strong>loonda dae: </strong>I would say it’s like the new wave of soul…</p>
      <p><em>(laughter erupts)</em></p>
      <p><strong>ora: </strong>Nooo you did not say that</p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What is the new wave of soul?</p>
      <p><strong>red: </strong>It’s not old school – </p>
      <p><strong>ora:</strong> It’s soul music, but it’s more established and comes out in more of the jazz, and I was like yeah, she’s right! And I came to rehearsal and I’ve been coming ever since. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> You guys were a band before, as SHE in the past, how did you guys kind of evolve into Highness? What is Highness to you guys?</p>
      <p><strong>gem tree: </strong>We went through a lot of changes during SHE, with people, sound and performances and everything and we learned very quickly, spur of the moment. Also being set in ourselves, and being in the band and us growing individually we kind of formed Highness. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What do you think you have learned most about yourself playing music or being a musician?</p>
      <p><strong>red:</strong> I would say that I’m insecure…Just to be real, real quick. Playing drums and stuff, sometimes I think too much when I play and I don’t trust myself a lot. So as a musician I learned that I have trust issues. I guess that’s kind of like the con with the pro. </p>
      <p><strong>loona dae:</strong> I would say something that I learned being a vocalist and a musician is to be vulnerable and to be confident.</p>
      <p><strong>schenay: </strong>Patience and consistency. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>So how is your dynamic as a band? Do you guys sort of play off of each other? Are you guys close?</p>
      <p><strong>loona dae:</strong> We’re a band collective so it’s what we do, and what we bring to the table, we take away from the table.  That’s the best way I can describe it. It does bring a strong community because you can always have a fellow musician that can understand what you’re going through and your sound and your ideas and you can’t always find that. When you find that you should keep it. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Do any of you have siblings? I feel like maybe it would be like having sisters or something like that.</p>
      <p><strong>red:</strong> It definitely is for me. I don’t have any sisters; I got all brothers so like it’s a learning process having sisters. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> You guys just released your new EP <em>Young Taboo</em>, how was working on that? What was the process like?</p>
      <p><strong>gem tree:</strong> I love it. Definitely. If you ask me I rewrite a million times, if I don’t like it I listen to it over and over until its right. It’s nerve wrecking, but it’s awesome. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Why did you guys decide to call it <em>Young Taboo</em>? What is taboo to you?</p>
      <p><strong>schenay:</strong> Something different, something that you don’t quite understand but is normal to the individual doing it.</p>
      <p><strong>loona dae:</strong> What <em>Young Taboo</em> means to me is that it’s about a young generation being brought up in a taboo world.  One that is thinking and a lot of it is seen as abnormal and disturbance but that’s the way that we communicate. It’s that young taboo, they don’t understand it, but we get it. There’s a purpose behind it. We’re trying to get somewhere. </p>
      <p><strong>ora: </strong>I think it’s also this idea of like questioning what it is and that applying to everything. There’s like what you’ve been shown, but like what is it. And that idea of figuring it out, and that in and of itself is seen as such a problem with people. People get scared when you question things; they just want you to accept it. So it’s just like this idea of asking questions, where do you come from, what does it mean to you, how do you see it, and that’s something that you have to figure out.<br />
      amfm: You guys have the big song, “Have a Nice Day,” I just want to know what’s like your ideal nice day? If you had like a last day, what would that day look like?</p>
      <p><strong>loona dae:</strong> When you wake up and it’s humid and sunny, and it’s a cool breeze coming through the window and you got half a joint like right there – </p>
      <p><strong>red:</strong> Half a joint?</p>
      <p><strong>loona dae: </strong>I’m talking about a wake and bake – </p>
      <p><strong>red: </strong>I need a whole one. </p>
      <p><em>(laughter)</em></p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Well maybe it’s like a surprise and it’s there and you’re like oh!</p>
      <p><strong>red: </strong>True</p>
      <p><strong>loona dae: </strong>That’s a good day. And you look in the fridge and you got food in there</p>
      <p><strong>gem tree:</strong> And you’re happy all day long, not a worry for the day. </p>
      <p><strong>ora: </strong>You wake up with purpose in your heart. </p>
      <p><strong>gem tree:</strong> And drive. And fight. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What gives you guys drive to keep on going and getting up and making music everyday and keep pushing towards?</p>
      <p><strong>ora: </strong>When you can’t do anything else. That’s all it is. </p>
      <p><strong>loona dae: </strong>You can’t do anything else, you don’t have a choice. </p>
