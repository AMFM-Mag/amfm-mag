      <p><strong>Jay Anderson</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">To call James Julius Anderson (better known as &ldquo;Jay&rdquo;) a prolific saxophone player would be a definite understatement. In the month of June alone he performed at 35 gigs, including three sets at Milwaukee's Summerfest. He&rsquo;s played alongside jazz ensembles, Latin, Afrobeat, psychedelic rock, surf pop, folk punk, and hip-hop bands, to name a few. The first time I sat down with the 22-year-old was after Locust Street Festival here in Milwaukee, where he played with two different bands, before and after a set with another band at another festival.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Since that night I&rsquo;ve been to his Riverwest home a number of times to sit in on practices and private house shows. It&rsquo;s a warm, sunny place full of plant life, good food, books, art, music, instruments, tapestries, sculptures, and artifacts from all over the world. It&rsquo;s also become a gathering place for the vibrant Milwaukee music scene, including the launch pad for his latest project, Foreign Goods, a supergroup made up of Milwaukee musicians from New Age Narcissim, Soul Low, The Remedy, and Klassik.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>How did you start playing music?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">jay anderson:</strong> My grandpa was a farmer and a saxophone player in Gary, Indiana. It totally skipped my dad, he didn&rsquo;t play any instruments, but he loved jazz. One of the few things I remember from an early age was my dad singing and scatting around the house. Some cop came to my elementary school who could play a bunch of instruments. He had them set up onstage, he drew the curtains, he went down the line and played all of them. When he played the sax I said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine right there.&rdquo; I was in 4th grade and I started playing sax the next year. I had a few lessons in band class and throughout my life I&rsquo;ve only had about 20 lessons.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>Who are your influences?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">anderson: </strong>Ravi Shankar is probably my single biggest musical influence. A lot of people can't hear it in my playing, but it's more conceptual. It's about how you zone out when you&rsquo;re zoning in. The next one would be John Coltrane, who was actually really good friends with Shankar. Coltrane named his son after Ravi. The way you conceptualize South Indian classical music is super similar to what Coltrane and those guys were doing with modal music in the 50s and 60s on records like Bitches Brew and Kind of Blue. There&rsquo;s also Fela Kuti, Willie Bobo, HÃ©ctor Lavoe, a lot of South Indian and Middle Eastern musicians. There's this cat Ali Akbar Khan, he's like the master of the Indian sarod. The way they play it, it sounds so close to the human voice. They have notes that are in between our notes, and they hear them deeply. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>Any particular ones that stand out or push you other ways than musically?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">anderson: </strong>As an artist, like the total package, Amy Winehouse is my number one. She was it and she died so early. I'll go home and watch her videos and I can't even help it. She's all real, all the time, none of it's an act. When you're honest other humans can't help but respond to it. I learned that from Amy. She gave me the confidence to dance onstage and make eye contact with the audience. And that put me in the position to get the gigs I've gotten. I play with a lot of musicians all over town, and somehow I skipped the whole phase of sleeping in a van and going on tour and playing at tiny bars in the middle nowhere to get a following. I don&rsquo;t know how I skipped that, but I went immediately from high school and college level playing to hiring my teachers for gigs.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>Why haven&rsquo;t you moved to a bigger market like New york?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">anderson: </strong>I really think it's about inspiration. We have the internet now. I could go, and I'm sure it would be great, but maybe not. I just have too many friends who've gone to Boston, New York, LA, good people and good musicians, and &nbsp;they've toured the world with some killers, but they move back to Milwaukee. They go out there and spend all their money, get stressed out and broken down, then they have to move back in with their parents to save money to rent a place in Riverwest. All the while I've been here practicing, booking gigs and making connections. So many people are still operating on this model of Old America where you have to get out and do this and do that, but to me it seems like a waste of time. I tell them to enjoy themselves, try to meet some badasses, take lots of pictures and bring me back a rock. The main thing they learn is that motherfuckers aren't playing with you about this music thing. If you found the right people in Milwaukee you would've known that before you left. I also have a strong belief in bringing people here. Go out and learn, then bring it back. At some point I'll buy property and travel. But right now I want to help raise the level of musicianship in Milwaukee. Let someone fly me out to New York after I've established myself here at home, but I'm not trying to go there and struggle. I'm not interested in leaving the house until my bed's made.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>How has your understanding of music changed since you started?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">anderson: </strong>My thing now is, how do I make people dance? How do I engage the audience? I understand there is cerebral music, there&rsquo;s a bebop tradition and there&rsquo;s an orchestral music tradition. An excellent musician has an intimate relationship with their instrument. There are places and times for those people. That&rsquo;s when you put on a tuxedo and you go see the symphony orchestra and you shut your mouth and listen. Or it&rsquo;s when you pay good money to see a weekend show at a jazz club. The musicianship is on another level, that&rsquo;s why it costs so much. Because they know something about their instrument that you may not know in this lifetime and they&rsquo;re demonstrating it for you. At some point in my life I&rsquo;d like to get to that level. But an excellent artist takes themselves, their band mates, the club owner, the audience, and the rest of the city into account as opposed to just the instrument. Those are two very different types of performers, and right now I&rsquo;m mostly concerned with being an excellent artist. There are so many jazz musicians who dress like they just got out of jury duty, they sit in a chair, they play their instrument and hardly say anything. Fuck that. My question is can you play a gig and pay attention to the audience? Don&rsquo;t get all high and mighty with me about what you think is going on, if a deaf alien landed on Earth and came to your gig, all they need to see is there are some hairless apes onstage doing something with things that are making other hairless apes move their bodies.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>How did your new group Foreign Goods form?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">anderson: </strong>Foreign Goods was birthed out of my desire to make quality music with people my age that have an actual social impact, not just pack a club. When I make music with a band of motherfuckers who&rsquo;ve been owning this shit for as long as I&rsquo;ve been alive, that&rsquo;s easy, but getting a band together of musicians my age doing the same level of work, that&rsquo;s a totally different thing. I can take more liberties with those older guys because they are masters, but with Foreign Goods we all need to come with 150% because we don&rsquo;t always know what&rsquo;s happening, and we need to figure it out together. I want to squeeze every drop of artistry from every person in this band, like I&rsquo;m wringing a towel out. I want to push them to the very edge of what they're willing to give me, because it will make us better. We will jam on an idea like ten times, no words. Then on the eleventh time we&rsquo;ll nail it down to a certain number of bars, then Klassik will write lyrics, then we will write harmonies. Klassik is great because he also plays an instrument, he can sing like Michael Jackson, he can rap - he&rsquo;s a wordsmith. Then he takes my melodies and writes his lyrics and hooks, after that we can make harmonies and countermelodies. Everyone in the band sings. Tim Russell can sing, Kiran Vee can sing and rap, I can sing, Sam Gehrke can belt it out if you nudge him enough, if you talk enough shit before the show. You gotta hurt Sam's feelings before he lets loose.I have a big ear. I&rsquo;ve learned lots of different styles like Indian music, Afrobeat, Latin music and funk. Foreign Goods is dope because we have everyones input, everyone&rsquo;s various musical backgrounds. And I&rsquo;m by no means the leader.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">amfm: </strong>But it feels like you&rsquo;re the leader...<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-514d98a8-c235-6bc2-6d7e-7a315a052d09">anderson: </strong>The way the stars form, there are these clouds of interstellar dust, very basic molecules and elements, celestial dust, and there&rsquo;s huge clouds of it, some of them are 14 billion light years across, but because it&rsquo;s in deep space where nothing else happens, all the molecules in the cloud are equally spaced apart. This is where the music analogy comes in. Kiran&rsquo;s been killing it for a long ass time, and so has Sam Gehrke. Tim Russell&rsquo;s been killing it for a long time, so has Klassik. I been killing it for a long time too. I had no conscious intention of it. Me and Kiran got together for fried chicken and we played as a duo for an hour and a half. Then I was like, &ldquo;I been jamming with Sam Gehrke and Tim Russell for five months, you should come play piano,&rdquo; and he was like, &ldquo;Hey, I have a band called New Age Narcissism and you should probably come play saxophone.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re all in totally different places, perfect amount of space apart, and when stars form something happens, a supernova could explode somewhere, a shockwave could go through the solar system, and because the basic laws of physics, when two molecules get closer together in a vacuum it makes more gravity, creating a gravity well, so all these molecules get closer together and the temperature rises until they ignite and make a star. That&rsquo;s how life starts. So by no means am I the leader of the group because if anyone left the group, it wouldn&rsquo;t be Foreign Goods. It&rsquo;s more like the nucleus got to act through me.<br />
