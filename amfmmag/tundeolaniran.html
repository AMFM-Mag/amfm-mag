      <p dir="ltr">Tunde Olaniran is more than just a brown boy. In his popular single he raps, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m every single thing you think of me/I&rsquo;m a sinner, killer, drug dealer, refugee.&rdquo; You can add amazing and fierce to that list as well. Hailing from Flint Michigan, he is a powerhouse making a name for himself through his unique music and conscious lyrics laid over trap and electronic beats that he produces himself. Something feels good about dancing and getting grimey to music where the lyrics are actually worth listening to. </p>      <p>Besides gender-bending, Olaniran, genre-bends as well. His influences are across the spectrum, from funk to rap, and rock and punk even, all of them melding together to create his own signature style. On his most recent five song EP Yung Archetype, he explores identity politics, the internet, Whole Foods, capitalism, and the ills of society. In the likes of Le1f and M.I.A., who he cites as inspiration, his heavy hitting beats, androgyny, humor, queer friendly vibe, and big personality, make Olaniran a natural performer. Sequins, grills and all, he kills it on the stage and on the mic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">amfm: </strong>How did you get into making music? Have you always been interested in performing?</p>
<strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">tunde olaniran:</strong> I started out as a session vocalist, making money recording country music demos if you can believe that. I had an opportunity to perform in a big singing competition and the energy of doing that gave me a desire to do more. Like many other starry-eyed college students before me, I looked around and found a band to join, playing rock with hints of metal, funk, and pop. That gave me a taste of writing, recording, arranging, and performing live. When M.I.A. first came out with &quot;Arular,&quot; it inspired me to try my hand at production and I eventually decided to become a solo artist. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">amfm: </strong>How has it been for you being an openly gay black male rapper? Do you think music is embracing queer artists more? Why do you think visibility and having a voice is important?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">tunde: </strong>This is such a great question. The truth is that I don't identify as LGBT at all. I don't say that defensively because there is nothing wrong with being gay. In some ways, I'm fine with people assuming I'm gay because it allows me to get a gauge to &quot;screen out&quot; bigots. I'm very comfortable having traits people might see as feminine or not traditionally masculine. Many of my heroes and role models are women, many of the people in my life I admire are women and it has shaped how I interact with the world. It&rsquo;s important to remember that even heterosexual artists face a very narrow window of expression that gets even slimmer if you are a black male. Heteronormative social policing hurts everyone to some extent in that it kills potential in how we can be in the world. I can't tell you how pressed black people can get over just a picture of me that a blog might post. It's not possible that I'm anything but a drag queen, you know? That's why we need people like Mykki Blanco, Stromae, Le1f, Cakes Da Killah, etc to keep interrupting the same tired narratives of male Blackness. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">amfm: </strong>You seem to have many alter egos in your music, how were they all born? Do they intersect and how are they different from one another?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">tunde: </strong>I don't think I have alter egos, but I love playing with different voices and inflections. My grandmother is a great imitator and I probably get that from her. I started out singing just by imitating other singers and it taught me how to approach vocals from a million different directions: &quot;Should I handle this like Missy? like Kate Bush, like Nina Simone?&quot; My voice is kind of my Swiss Army knife in that way. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">amfm: </strong>How did you end up in Flint Michigan? You were raised in London and Germany, and you have Nigerian roots, what about your history, places and identities that you hold influence you as a person and musically?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">tunde:</strong> I was born in Flint and it's where my mom is originally from, so when my parents split up we came back to this city. I've always felt like a transient outsider growing up. Even though my mom kept our home filled with friends and family, I would spend a lot of time alone in my own world. I would often think I was in a movie grown up, and my mom kind of encouraged that creativity. Living in so many places made me appreciate that there's no one right way to be a human being. It's a waste of time to try and fit in where you don't feel wanted and loved. There is always somewhere else for you to be, with people that can love you. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">amfm: </strong>You released your EP &quot;Yung Archetype&quot; what is the significance of the title and what are you trying to say about yourself as an artist through this short yet sweet five song set? Brown Boy talked about identity and gentrification, where do you get your inspiration from?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">tunde:</strong> I really didn&rsquo;t have much beyond a desire to release content that felt more accurate of where I&rsquo;d gotten to in my live shows. The only other personal challenge was: &ldquo;Can I make something really lyrically meaningful and substantive without having to turn down?&rdquo; Dance and movement is very important to me, so the music would have to be facilitative to that. I get inspired by the next step from interactions, relationships. I like to think about deeper implications inherent in how we treat each other, how we look at the world, what are the systems like? So then I have this song about dismantling oppressive black male body narratives, and I have to break it back down to something really simple and crunk like &ldquo;Brown Boy.&rdquo; The title &ldquo;Yung Archetype&rdquo; was one of those moments of some of the mystery in creation. I can&rsquo;t say exactly why I chose the name. It almost happened in reverse, where the name came to me, then later the choice started to make more sense, and even informed the aesthetic for live shows and videos. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">amfm: </strong>You have a day job at Planned Parenthood, working that 9 to 5 to stay alive, how do you juggle crafting your art and passion for music?</p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-fccb27b4-cbf4-87cd-dd47-76c2800b3462">tunde: </strong>It&rsquo;s hard. I should probably get more sleep. I&rsquo;m really lucky to work somewhere that wants its employees to be &lsquo;whole&rsquo; people, and to have fulfillment. So they don&rsquo;t resent if you have a life and passions beyond work. I&rsquo;m also grateful for the moments when I can draw in people from my life as artist into the work I do with Planned Parenthood. The work we do is mainly around health outreach, and youth leadership development. So there is a place for creativity in that. <br />
