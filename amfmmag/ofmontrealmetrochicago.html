      <p><strong>Of Montreal: Metro Chicago </strong><br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">When it comes to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day weekend, the city of Chicago is like a drunken apocalypse. And, the one neighborhood where all the drunken revelers congregate is of course, Wrigleyville, where Of Montreal performed to a sold out crowd at Metro on this bacchanalian holiday. </p>
I found myself walking into the Metro doors on that animated Friday night. As I headed to the balcony and the lights began to dim, whatever was occurring outside with the invasion of green partygoers was completely separate from the bizarre world I was about to enter inside. All of a sudden, a guy in a blood red cape, mask and black top hat appeared on stage, sort of Phantom of the Opera-esque, and the crowd went wild. He stood at a podium, energized the already lively audience decked out in wigs, fur and crazy face paint, and introduced the band.  <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Frontman Kevin Barnes appeared on stage donning blue eyeshadow and a white sport coat. Barnes exuded a stage presence that was instantly energizing and imaginative as he started off the set with &ldquo;Heimdalsgate Like A Promethean Curse&rdquo; (2007, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?). During almost every song, different costumed actors would take to the stage pantomiming as masked angels, animals and other quirky characters. The theatrical and dreamlike antics dominated the musical experience, as the music seemed more of an accompaniment to the colorful performers and psychedelic kaleidoscope of visuals in the backdrop. However, that said, the music didn&rsquo;t disappoint. </p>
      It was an hour and a half set list of playful old favorites like &ldquo;Forerecast Fascist Future&rdquo; and &ldquo;Suffer for Fashion&rdquo; as well as newer tracks like &ldquo;Bassem Sabry&rdquo; and &ldquo;Empyrean Abattoir&rdquo; from their recently released album Aureate Gloom. The band kept the crowd alive one song after the next, especially during &ldquo;Bunny Ain't No Kind of Rider&rdquo; (2007, Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?), when everyone in the packed Metro house was singing along in harmony with Barnes.  <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Halfway through the show, Barnes decided to switch gears and go back to the band&rsquo;s southern, honky tonk roots from Georgia, and he called &quot;deceased&quot; country singer Kitty Wells to the stage who was actually Elizabeth Wheeler. The audience quieted down a bit during Wheeler's ballad until Barnes returned to the stage in a white blouse and pants-free (i.e. Tom Cruise in Footloose style). He sang one more song while the fans moshed below, and the band left the stage with the crowd hungry for more.</p>
      The Phantom of the Opera emcee jumped out once more to get the fans riled up again before the encore began with &ldquo;Gronlandic Edit&rdquo; (2007, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?) and ended with &ldquo;Wraith Pinned to the Mist&rdquo; (2005, The Sunlandic Twins), while a creepy looking dog character crowd surfed to close off the show. Overall, I would recommend you to make an effort to see Of Montreal, more so for the elaborate stage set and spectacle of a performance than just for the music itself.<br />
