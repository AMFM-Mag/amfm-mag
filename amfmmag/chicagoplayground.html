      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8d7232d4-caea-6607-ac06-ada8a8fd8362">amfm: </strong>You used to be captain of the basketball team back in high school and are now designing a line inspired by your love of the game, how did you get into designing and why did you want to pursue creating your own sports inspired brand?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8d7232d4-caea-6607-ac06-ada8a8fd8362">chicago playground: </strong>Being a Student of the game of basketball, I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of the letterman and varsity jackets based upon the concept of how they represent one&rsquo;s accomplishments along one&rsquo;s journey; whether it be through high school or college. I got into designing 10 years ago by being inspired by how fashion moves on emotion based upon style. Going into building Chicago Playground, I wanted to build and create a brand that had substance. With the varsity and letterman jackets, I love how they tell a visual story amongst whomever is wearing the garments. It&rsquo;s what I like to call a &ldquo;conversation piece.&rdquo;<br />
      </p>

I wanted open the portal of one being complete when given the opportunity to design a piece in which represents thyself. </p>

A city where many talents are originated; back to when we were children having several different talents on the playground, and now as adults, we still possess those talents of art. Being I&rsquo;m from Chicago, it&rsquo;s more embedded in me the different aspects of influence the city hold. Whether it be from the likes of sports to music, and culture. </p>
