/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

    <h2><strong><a href="calidb.html">Q&amp;A:  CALID B</a></strong></h2>
    <p>Calid B is what you would call a triple threat in the creative sphere. He's a musician, a fire producer, and is the founder of his own clothing brand called Ochio, a combination of his Ohio roots, and his current home in Chicago. His roots don't just lie there, Calid orignally hails from Cote D'Ivoire, and his African roots are most prevalent in his most recent EP, <em>Afrobang</em>.</p>

    <h2><a href="pitchfork2016.html" target="_blank">REVIEW: PITCHFORK MUSIC FESTIVAL </a></h2>
    <p>Summer Sixteen at Pitchfork was a bodily experience. Whether you were staying hydrated with Mick Jenkins, swapping lover&rsquo;s spit with Broken Social Scene, getting glowed up with Anderson Paak, or experiencing a spiritual awakening with FKA Twigs, this year&rsquo;s installment of the festival had a little something to offer for everyone. <br />

    <h2><a href="angelhaze.html">Q&amp;A: ANGEL HAZE</a></h2>
    <p>If anyone should be rapping &ldquo;Started From the Bottom,&rdquo; it should be Angel Haze. The 23-year-old Detroit native, who had a rocky upbringing, grew up homeless, lived in the woods, left their label and leaked their own debut album <em>Dirty Gold</em>, which ultimately could have cost them everything, but what is everything to a person who knows what nothing feels like?</p>

    <h2><a href="emmittjames.html">Q&amp;A: EMMITT JAMES</a></h2>
    <p>Emmitt James makes that everyday people type of music - hip-hop telling stories about lost love, burning rice, ATM fees and his lackluster financial situation.  He may be a starving artist, after all his most recent EP is called “Hunger Pains,” but he is wealthy with words of wisdom, and a flow that is rooted in passion and drive, which is priceless.

    <h2><a href="queentut.html">Q&amp;A: QUEEN TUT</a></h2>
    <p>Seshat Queen Tut crowned herself well before she began performing for the public, but it didn&rsquo;t take long for the confident emcee to gain loyal subjects. Tut made a splash in her debut feature, inviting listeners to join her artistic journey on the opening verse of AR Wesley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Drug Flow RMX.&rdquo; Since then she&rsquo;s laced her royal rhymes</p>

    <h2><a href="dwin.html">Q&amp;A: D-WIN</a></h2>
    <p>Darius Winfield, better known as D-Win, is always winning - at music, at creative vision, at style, and at Kubrick. The Indianapolis bred emcee came to Chicago with a dream and a mission and hasn&rsquo;t stopped for anyone or anything. Formerly one half of the hip hop duo The Rocketeers, D-Win is no stranger to the limelight.</p>
