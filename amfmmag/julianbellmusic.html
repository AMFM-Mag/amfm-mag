      <p><strong>Julian Bell</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">If the name Julian Bell doesn&rsquo;t ring familiar, then soon it will. This rising young artist out of Chicago is heading back to the music basics and making some headway on his music career as a rock and blues guitarist. Looks can be deceiving, but his melodies are not, and neither is his finger work. No he is not a rapper, although he did play with Vic Mensa at Lollapalooza last year. And no he is not the next Miguel, although he does have a soulful croon. </p>
      <p dir="ltr">From acoustic to electric guitar, from chord to chord and blues scale, his plucking skills, and his cadence, he might just be the next John Mayer, Lenny Kravitz or Jimi Hendrix. Or why compare him to anyone at all, Bell stands alone, taking influences from some of his favorite musicians and reinventing it, telling the world through his music this is who I am.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm: </strong>You first began playing the guitar at a young age. Do you remember when you decided that it would be your instrument of choice and how you felt playing it in the beginning as a young kid?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">julian bell:</strong> I was a kid who used to sing around the house and bang on my mom&rsquo;s pots and pans to different CD&rsquo;s. I was around 10 or 11 years old when I started playing guitar. My parents wanted me to play an instrument and it was either going to be the piano or guitar. I saw the guitarist at my church using different pedals to give the guitar a different sound. After seeing that, that's when I decided that I wanted to play. Like any new challenge, learning to play guitar was rough in the beginning, but I realized it was something that I loved and so I stuck with it. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm: </strong>You started off playing for your church and doing musicals and plays at school. How did those musical beginnings influence you wanting to further pursue music and influence the style of music youdo? Was music always something you wanted to do?<br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">bell: </strong>I grew up around a lot of amazing musicians in church and that definitely influenced my taste and style of music. I knew I wanted to pursue music pretty early on. I remember day dreaming in class in elementary school about being on tour and playing shows. Later, I went to a small private high school and there weren&rsquo;t a lot of opportunities for me to express myself musically. The school had a pretty good drama program. Musicals were one of the few options to do something music related at school and so I just fell into that. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm: </strong>Your music spans many genres and is a combination of rock and blues, with a bit of modern style thrown in as well. You sing from your soul. In this day and age some music is not like that, and youdon't see too many African American male musicians rocking out, usually rap/hip hop and R&amp;B is of interest. Where does your musical influence come from? Who were you inspired by or listening to growing up?<br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">bell: </strong>Yea, being a black musician that plays rock music is always interesting. When I talk to people and they find out that I&rsquo;m a musician, they usually expect me to rap or sing R&amp;B. Playing rock music isn't something that&rsquo;s weird to me because that&rsquo;s what I enjoy creating and performing. It has never really bothered me that some find it &ldquo;weird,&rdquo; but I do understand why it might be strange to people who aren't used to seeing a black guy on stage singing with a guitar and he has his distortion on ten. I respect the past, and I hope to represent black musicians in the right way. Looking back through history, there are plenty of black musicians who were rocking out from Jimi Hendrix, Buddy Guy, to Chuck Berry, Prince and the list goes on. Growing up in the metropolitan DC area, which is a melting pot of many different cultures and people, helped me to prepare for what Chicago had to offer. I've always been someone who can hang out with different people no matter what scene they&rsquo;re in. I'd be in church hearing gospel music and then go to school and someone is talking about Linkin Park or G-Unit (middle school life). My family is Jamaican so I heard a lot of Reggae at family events and my Dad loved Jazz, so I was listening to that as well as other styles of music. John Mayer was a big influence for me growing up. &nbsp;He was one of the first artists I saw who was doing exactly what I wanted to do. I remember seeing Michael Jackson as a kid and just being amazed at the things he was doing. I listen to so much music, so I pull influences from everywhere - Pop, Rock, R&amp;B, Rap, Jazz. I know it&rsquo;s clich√© but basically anything but Country I'm probably going to listen to it. There&rsquo;s a lot of good music out there, you just have to look a little harder for it. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm: </strong>So you're originally from DC and came to Chicago to pursue an education at Columbia in music and try to further your career. How else did your music beginnings in DC prepare you for what Chicago has to offer? How was it in the beginning for you?</p>
<strong>bell: </strong>As for my music beginnings, I didn't have any friends in school that wanted to pursue music like I did, so playing my guitar was something I did when I went home after play rehearsals or soccer practice. I'd go on YouTube and play along to B.B King, Jimi Hendrix, and other artists. I just practiced everyday so when I got to Chicago I was able to compete and stand out. When I came to Chicago, I was very green when it came to knowing anything about the music industry or what it took to be a professional musician. So my first two years at Columbia College was time that I spent just figuring things out. In my mind, I'm definitely still at the beginning of my career. I've done some cool stuff, but I haven't reached the goals I have for myself yet. 
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm: </strong>But you've done a bit in that time frame too from performing on The Next and attempting The Voice, performing with Vic Mensa at Lolla, and many shows in the city as well. How do you feel you have evolved as an artist and musician in that span of time? What has been your biggest takeaway?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">bell: </strong>I feel that I have evolved in a lot of ways as an artist and as a person. I'd say I've become more aware of different aspects of music and figuring out who I am as a person. My taste in music has become more diverse but also more precise at the same time. I've worked with, and still do work with, a lot of great producers and artists in the city; I've learned a lot from them and that has helped me to become a better artist and musician. Also, I've learned a lot about how the business works and how you can't really plan or bank on something being the moment because it may not be what you expected.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm:</strong> What was the inspiration behind your debut EP you released a couple years ago? Where did you begin in the making of it? What were you trying to say with this debut? </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">bell: </strong>I released my EP back in February of 2012. It was more a collection of songs that I had written over a period of time and I thought they were good enough to move forward with. I could tell you the inspiration behind every song and where it was written, so it&rsquo;s cool to look back to that moment of time. Putting out <em>Where Do I Begin</em> was more so to show the world that I can do this. I was playing a lot of shows, but I had no music out for people to listen to after the shows so I needed to put something out. This next project I'm working on is going to be another collection of genre-bending songs; it&rsquo;s going to have a different sound from the first EP<em> Where Do I Begin</em>. This time I'm drawing from more of my influences and honing in on the sound that I want. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">amfm: </strong>You have a song called &quot;Who I Am.&quot; If you had to tell someone who you are, what would you say?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-4a16b49e-2262-8468-90a2-6f21cbedf88a">bell:</strong> I would say that I'm a guy who wants to be a master of my craft. I'm always trying to find ways to go further with my music and sometimes I get in my own way because my standards are so high. I love music and I want to share that with the world. Music is one of the most powerful mediums in the world and if I can make someone feel good about their day, to take their mind off whatever is bothering them, or just get them to get let loose with my music, then I did my job. <br />
