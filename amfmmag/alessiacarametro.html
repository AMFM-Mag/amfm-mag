      <p><strong>      Alessia Cara: Metro Chicago</strong> </p>
      <p dir="ltr">No one was questioning what they were doing at Metro Chicago when Alessia Cara came to town. Cara, who is Canadian, and only 18, rose quickly to stardom after the success of her song &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; which talks about the perils of fitting in and adolescence. &ldquo;I'm sorry if I seem uninterested/ Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent / Truly, I ain't got no business here / But since my friends are here/ I just came to kick it but really / I would rather be at home all by myself not in &nbsp;&nbsp;room / With people who don't even care about my well-being.&rdquo; Bet they care now.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Opening for her was an eclectic mix of music genres. First up was Leaf, who had a futuristic, &nbsp;indie hip-hop vibe. She came out in a silver velvet jumpsuit with two dancers in all black and Leaf t-shirts. Her music had heavy bass, with a sultry feel as she sang &ldquo;You should let me wife you.&rdquo; The night was definitely all for the ladies, Leaf noted how many women and girls were in the crowd and dedicated her song &ldquo;M.O.N.E.Y&rdquo; to all the independent women in the audience. Girl power was on 10, so was the energy from Leaf, which was a nice way to open up the show for the evening.</p>
      <p class="content" dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/leaf.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="leaf" /><br />
      <em>(Leaf)</em></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The second opener was Craig Stickland, an acoustic guitarist, who had long hair, a winning smile, and a croon with a twang. He strummed his guitar and sang about relationships lost, hellos, and being lovelorn. All those ladies in the audience fell for him in the midst of his half hour set, especially during his song &ldquo;Deja Vu,&rdquo; about when you know something is bad for you, but you keep going back over and over. He soulfully screamed &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break every rule in the book for you baby!&rsquo; and the crowd went wild. He also scored points for doing a cover of Adele&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; which although has been done countless times, had a nice refreshing acoustic indie country vibe.</p>

        <em><span class="content">(Craig Stickland)</span></em><br />
        <br />
      The last opener before Cara was Kevin Garrett, a synthesizer-pianist, who had a drummer and keyboardist accompany him. If Sam Smith, James Blake and Policia had a baby, Garrett would be it. His music was like a lullaby. At the right time and place it would have been welcomed; but after two openers, and still the main act to go, it was oddly placed. However, despite that, it was well received by the audience, again mostly consisting of women, who mostly seemed to be enraptured by his blond hair and mesmerized by his voice.</p>

      </p>
<p dir="ltr">After everyone was singing her praises for bringing this entire evening together, Alessia Cara came onto the stage wide eyed and with a youthful bounce and energy. She truly is the girl next door with a humble nature of someone who is just at the brink of her success. She opened with &ldquo;Baby I&rsquo;m Yours,&rdquo; a young girl&rsquo;s anthem to breaking down the walls around the heart and opening up to someone new. There is a certain innocence and charm to Cara&rsquo;s stage presence. At one point she addressed the crowd and talked about how amazing it is that she gets to live out her dream every day, urging the audience to never stop dreaming.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/alessia2.jpg" width="525" height="250" /><span class="content"><em>(Alessia Cara</em></span><em>)</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">She performed songs from her album Know-It-All. A highlight of her set was a stripped down portion where she covered of Rihanna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diamonds,&rdquo; and when someone threw their boxers on stage. That&rsquo;s definitely not something you see every day. Again ladies were winning tonight. She slowed things down in the midst of the upbeat ballads and performed a song called &ldquo;Stoned,&rdquo; which she said was about that one person in your life who is your rock. &ldquo;Scars To Your Beautiful,&rdquo; was a powerful song, a message for girls to be themselves overlaying a beautiful piano melody.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Of course she saved &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; the song that everyone came for and knew and loved, for near the end. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here because of this song, so thank you,&rdquo; she told the audience. Thankful they were as they sang their hearts out with her. </p>
