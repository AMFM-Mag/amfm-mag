      <p><strong>Detroit Techno Militia</strong>      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">When Angie Linder came up with the concept of Detroit Techno Militia, it was to band together the techno soldiers of Detroit and celebrate the city and its root&rsquo;s in electronic music. DJ Seoul, and T. Linder are two of those musical soldiers, who have been making music in Detroit for over a decade and have seen Detroit evolve before their eyes.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">The Detroit Techno Militia is known for taking musical risks that truly showcase the passion of the DJs and producers behind the collective. Having played all over the world, The Detroit Techno Militia took the Made in Detroit stage at Movement and pulled out all of the stops, including doing a 4x4 set with four DJ&rsquo;s and four turntables, all impromptu. These DJs are definitely pushing the craft and tradition of electronic music in Detroit.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">amfm: </strong>How have you seen the festival evolve over the years?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DJ Seoul: </strong>The production level gets better every year, I don&rsquo;t know how Paxahau does it. Until Paxahau took over it was completely different every year, you never really knew if it was going to happen until like a month before, which made it difficult if you were trying to come from out of town. But Paxahau came in and since then it&rsquo;s been really great. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re already planning for next yea</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">T. Linder: </strong>Playing Movement is always a pivotal moment for me. It&rsquo;s one of the gigs that I get most excited for. It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing to have a major techno and electronic event just ten minutes from my house. Every year is special for me.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">amfm: </strong>Why did you want to start Detroit Techno Militia?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">Detroit Techno Militia founder Angie Linder:</strong> I was involved with throwing parties and DJing and I really wanted to do something on my own. I love Detroit - Detroit music, Detroit DJs, everything to do with it. It was my way of wanting to something for Detroit, in Detroit, to totally pay homage to the city that I live in and bring other people to be involved with that.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">amfm: </strong>You compared what you guys are doing to restoring architecture, much of what&rsquo;s happening here in Detroit with buildings and music and arts, this kind of re-earthing, where do you see that synergy?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">Angie: </strong>Detroit at the time when we started Detroit Techno Militia was sort of this forgotten awesome thing that we loved, like a lot of the buildings like the train station. We have the shells; we had people that laid the groundwork. We wanted to support and build upon what was already here, not start something new, not take over, but just take what people are doing and lift it up, in the same way that you do a building and keep that beautiful architecture, the shell, and invest, time, money, effort, and sweat equity into it so that&rsquo;s exactly what we did.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">amfm: </strong>Detroit has been shown as like this fallen city, how do you feel about bringing in people through your music to discover Detroit and its roots?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">T. Linder:</strong> It&rsquo;s great, we have people coming from all over the world just to come for this. They&rsquo;re able to see that Detroit&rsquo;s not the bad place. It&rsquo;s not the horrible post apocalyptic wasteland. They bring something back to their homes and they&rsquo;re inspired by it. That synergy is inspiring to us.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DJ Seoul: </strong>One of Detroit&rsquo;s mottos is &ldquo;risen from the ashes like a phoenix,&rdquo; and we do it again and again. It&rsquo;s already like an artist&rsquo;s mecca now, not just for musicians, and artists, but craftspeople and everyone, and it&rsquo;s moving to the inner city and revitalizing it and making it beautiful. That&rsquo;s why techno is so awesome because everyone involved is involved somehow in the community, not for fame or recognition, but because this is our home. The media doesn&rsquo;t cover that. Showing the apocalypse for them is way more fun. They don&rsquo;t cover the new restaurant, they cover the burnt down restaurant. Detroit has already risen from the ashes and now the world is going to recognize it. It&rsquo;s going to survive no matter what, and that&rsquo;s the same way we feel about our music. The passion there is not going to go away. The city and its environment just hone it like a blacksmith every day.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">amfm: </strong>How did you guys get into techno music and DJing?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DTM: </strong>That&rsquo;s actually a funny story. My dad is a rock guy. He was a DJ for a radio station that played strictly rock and he played guitar. One day in like 87&rsquo; or so, we were in the car and Good Life came on the radio and I was like &lsquo;oh my god!&rdquo; and was asking him what the song was, and he&rsquo;s like &ldquo;oh you like that techno shit?&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m like &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s called? That&rsquo;s what I love! I was like 13 or 14 years old, and I would find songs with that element and it just built from there.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DJ Seoul:</strong> I&rsquo;m from Detroit. Even the DJs on the radio are amazing DJs. I think anywhere you&rsquo;re going to see someone good. You can&rsquo;t throw a rock without hitting an amazing musician. I mean Detroit has so much. Techno, Motown, Jazz music, everything. Detroit is music. To be a small part of that is a blessing.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">T. Linder: </strong>I first got into techno music when I was in college and throughout my whole youth, I had been hearing hearing Jeff Mills playing but I didn&rsquo;t realize it was techno music. When I got to the age where I started going to clubs, I thought to myself, this is where this comes from, and that&rsquo;s my root. When I saw that, I said that is what I&rsquo;m gonna do, and two months later I bought my turntables, had never touched vinyl before, but I said I&rsquo;m gonna do that and I haven&rsquo;t stopped since.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DJ Seoul:</strong> I started playing the drums in 1985, so I&rsquo;ve always had a music background. But when I found the party and underground scene in Detroit, and hearing it on the radio, I knew immediately.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">amfm: </strong>What do you guys love about detroit and what do you want people to know about it?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DJ Seoul:</strong> For me it&rsquo;s the best city in the world. It&rsquo;s the realest people you will ever meet. No bullshit. We don&rsquo;t have time for bullshit here. Everyone&rsquo;s gotta go to work. So come here, we&rsquo;ll love you, don&rsquo;t be afraid of it.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">T Linder: </strong>I&rsquo;ve lived here my whole life and I&rsquo;ve been all over and there&rsquo;s no city like it. there&rsquo;s absolutely no place in the world like Detroit. It can be tough, but the people are great, and I can&rsquo;t ever see myself moving out of the city because I get so much inspiration here.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">Angie:</strong> It&rsquo;s a feeling. I don&rsquo;t even think I can put into words what I feel. Just driving into the city, driving around, it makes the hair on my arms stand up still. It&rsquo;s emotional for me. We&rsquo;ve been asked why don&rsquo;t we go live in Germany, or do this, and because Miami Techno Militia, Las Vegas Techno Militia just doesn&rsquo;t have a good ring to it. I&rsquo;m tied into this city. I was born and raised here. I love everything about it.

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-60a3c2b8-5a66-53b5-6cfe-a84928210c26">DJ Seoul: </strong>We&rsquo;ve got a tough outer shell but Detroit&rsquo;s got a creamy middle.</p>
