      SXSW 2016 Recap</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Austin, Texas expanded to fit masses of artists, art lovers, and stylish spectators.  Covering every inch of the busy 6th street- which came to be the central hub of action and excitement for the week- was everything from booze, free swishers, naked painted Cowboys, and fully dressed commissioners of &quot;money for weed&quot;. SXSW carried a new energy around it, similar to elitist, yet a step or too away from it. However, isn't that the world we are in? Everything is for everybody unless you have not be chosen as &quot;somebody,&quot; then you are allowed to gracefully stand outside in line. </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Check out the recap from one of our contributing writers on the grounds below!</p>
      <p dir="ltr">The day had arrived to hit SXSW. We had some homies in town from <a href="http://www.the-life-project-chicago.com/blog/#" target="_blank">Private Stock Studios </a>at <a href="http://batbaraustin.com/" target="_blank">Bat Bar</a> on 6th St. <a href="http://www.lavangogh.net/">L.A. VanGogh</a> (Chicago Emcee) hit the stage at 2:30 p.m. for the <a href="http://aemmp.org/" target="_blank">AEMMP</a> Chicago showcase. AEMMP is a Chicago record label run by students at Columbia College. L.A. VanGogh represented Chicago to the fullest. After the set we walked around 6th St. to catch the vibe of the people. The street was packed with like minded individuals ready to party, battle, network, and get high on music. We walked off the beaten path with an appetite for destruction.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/lavangogh.JPG" width="525" height="250" alt="lavangogh" /><span class="content"><em>(L.A. VanGogh</em>)</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">It was a great day of record stores, shows, and photography. I went to <a href="http://juicelandmusic.com/records/" target="_blank">Exploded Records at Juice Land</a> at noon. <a href="http://dublab.com/" target="_blank">DUBLAB</a> (a non-profit online radio station out of Los Angeles, CA.) were broadcasting live out of the record store. I bought a 45 off of the <a href="http://exploded-drawing.com/" target="_blank">Exploded Drawing Label</a>. The record features music from Sound Founder, Kinder, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lo-phi">LO PHI</a>, and Sampler &amp; Son. I spoke with the owner of Exploded Drawing Record Store Andrew Brown (Sound Founder). He told me about the label, the store, and the overall operations. I highly recommend anyone who likes Vinyl Records to stop in there. They have an awesome shop.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">The next stop was <a href="http://hopecampaign.org/hopeprojects/hope-outdoor-gallery/" target="_blank">Hope Outdoor Gallery</a> after the record store. This park is like nothing I had ever seen. It is a giant hill with a castle at the top. Anyone could tag anywhere in the park. There were beautiful Murals everywhere. It was probably the highlight of my trip. This is a spot that was revisited more than once.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/hopegallery.JPG" width="525" height="250" alt="hope gallery" /><em class="content">(Hope Gallery)</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">We went to <a href="http://www.waterloorecords.com/" target="_blank">WaterLoo Records</a> where they were having a festival in the record store parking lot. <a href="https://www.subpop.com/releases/mass_gothic/mass_gothic" target="_blank">Mass Gothic</a> (Sub Pop Records) performed a set of heavy garage Rock. It was a great spot for music and records. I read a lot of reviews of the place and I was not disappointed.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">As my journey continued I walked back down 6th st. towards the Lit Lounge where there was a hip hop showcase that featured <a href="http://mickymunday.com/" target="_blank">Micky Mundays</a> and Jusalldrae. Micky Mundays recently released a video for his hit song &ldquo;Bye Felicia.&rdquo;</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/mickymunday.jpg" width="525" height="250" alt="micky munday" /><em><span class="content">(Micky Mundays and Jusalldrae</span></em>)<br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">It was about 5:00 pm and I was waiting on the homies to find a parking spot so I randomly walk into a bar on 6th st. called the Trophy Club. There was a band performing their first gig. It was nice to hear something different from all the hip hop I had been listening to the majority of the trip so far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Saturday we split up and went to see Talib Kweli, and my cousin, Marcel and I walked down 6th street and caught a couple of bands. We were going to go back to The <a href="http://www.the-life-project-chicago.com/blog/#" target="_blank">Hopes Art Gallery </a>to create some art. On our walk down 6th st. we stopped in Lit Lounge to see this Blues band jam. They were jamming like no other. We stuck around for two songs and continued our journey. Our walk led us to <a href="http://sixth.littlewoodrows.com/" target="_blank">Little Woodrows</a> where <a href="http://www.thedeadships.com/" target="_blank">The Dead Ships</a> (LA Rock trio), who are performing at Coachella 2016. They were a tight dynamic unit of sound. We caught the end of their set. I wish we could&rsquo;ve heard more from them.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There was a couple of guys selling hats so we went to go check out their product. The clothing brand is called <a href="http://www.shopgodson.com/" target="_blank">God Son</a>. They were some cool cats out of Texas just looking to connect with other musicians, artists, and people. We headed to the <a href="http://speakeasyaustin.com/" target="_blank">Speak Easy Lounge</a> for the Sol Collective Official SXSW showcase. I caught up with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/deuce-eclipse" target="_blank">Deuce Eclipse</a>. He is a Hispanic Hip Hop artist. He had great energy and stage presence.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><img src="../images/amfmmag/Duece Eclipse.JPG" width="525" height="250" alt="duece esclipse" /><em><span class="content">(Deuce Eclipse)</span></em></p>
      <p dir="ltr">After the showcase we headed to the Dweeb Squad House Party Vol. 3 where <a href="https://www.facebook.com/youarehere.chicago/" target="_blank">You Are Here</a> (Chicago Band) were performing at. The party was off the hook with badass DJs. The party eventually came to an end for us and reality began to set in. SXSW was over physically, but mentally we will continue connecting with like minded individuals looking to leave the world a better place than we left it.</p>
