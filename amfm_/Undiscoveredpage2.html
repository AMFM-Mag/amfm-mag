        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="content">Nancy has put painting on the back burner, though   she is not sure why, but she continues embracing new directions and   inspirations. With time, Hoffman has become cleaner, and more minimal in her   approach, which at times she finds more difficult than the more complex pieces   she’s done.<img src="images/Undiscovered/painting3.jpg" alt="painting" width="414" height="310" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
<p class="content"><img src="images/Undiscovered/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />“Every time I think I have a grasp on her artistic   style, she manages to completely reinvent herself as an artist, and I am once   again left guessing,” her daughter says. “The combination of all of these   elements truly makes her a great artist.” </p>
          <p class="content">Nancy Hoffman has been known to work on a piece for   quite some time, only to completely scrap the idea, or paint over the canvas and   start over. She says there is more time spent on gestation than anything else. </p>
          <p class="content">“It seems that there is much more time taken up by   the unconscious process than by the conscious process,” Hoffman says. “The   actual execution of the art is small compared to it, sometimes.”</p>
          <p class="content">For anyone with a craft, the worst critic is his or   herself. Artists of any kind can be really hard on themselves when it comes to   their work. Hoffman is modest when it comes to her art. She doesn’t seek out   exposure; she simply does it because it is what she knows, and what knows her.   She describes it as her “prayer.” </p>
          <p class="content">She says she has shown in a few places over the   years, and actually sold out once. Mostly though she sells to family and   friends, and has an art profile on Etsy.com. Her daughter, who is 23, doesn’t   recall of her mom showing which means that it has been quite some time since   Hoffman exhibited her talent to the masses.<img src="images/Undiscovered/painting2.jpg" alt="painting" width="333" height="231" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
          <p class="content">“I think my Mom is undiscovered for a few reasons,”   her daughter says. “Although her art is enlightening not only to me, but to many   people who have had the chance to see her pieces, she does not see her talent in   the way that we do.”</p>
          <p class="content">“She feels other artists are more talented than she   is, although of course I think this is ludicrous,” Jess Hoffman says   passionately. “Every artist is talented in their own way, and it is this   variation which makes the art world an inspiring place. It is also her   disability which impairs her from marketing her talent, but with my help, this   will no longer inhibit her progression from being undiscovered to being known   and respected.”</p>
          <p class="content">Nancy Hoffman’s body poses physical obstacles for   the tedious nature of art. She has a history of nerve pain, and suffers from   arthritis in her hands. She says their use is diminishing slowly over time, but   saying this she has a tone of optimism saying that they can be adapted to. </p>
          <p class="content">“Both of those have led to artistic breakthroughs   for me, some very small, just by modifying tools and having a new touch,”   Hoffman says. “I recommend all artists work with unfamiliar tools. Get a pencil   or paintbrush attached to the end of a long stick and draw or paint with   it.”<img src="images/Undiscovered/painting5.jpg" alt="painting" width="401" height="304" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
          <p class="content">Nancy Hoffman has spent her entire life creating an   amazing collection of art, and has devoted years of hard work to her passion.   Her daughter feels that recognition from those outside of her personal circle   would “convince her of her talent and ignite her artistic passion for good.” She   wants others to feel the inspiration that she feels when she thinks about her   mother’s art. </p>
          <p class="content">“Discovery” holds many different meanings for me.   We all pursue something with the hopes of sparking happiness within ourselves,   and it is art which ignites this spark in my mom,” Jess Hoffman says. </p>
          <p class="content">“I know that the sole respect, love and   appreciation I have given her throughout my life will always be enough   “discovery” for her. But I want nothing more than to see the love I have for her   art in the eyes of others,” she said.</p>
