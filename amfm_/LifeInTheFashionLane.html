      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4">L</span>ife on the runway can be tough, and   life behind the runway can be even more hectic. When you have a passion   for fashion you’d better want to put your blood, sweat and tears in   everything you do. Working in the Fashion Industry takes drive, dedication,   and lots of coffee to survive the wonderful world of fashion. </p>
        <p class="content">Jessica Cameron, a recent graduate   from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, like any other graduate in   this economy, is finding it <img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/jessieworking.jpg" alt="jessie" width="244" height="378" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />difficult to break into a career, <em>and </em> it just so happens to be the fashion industry, one of the hardest fields   to break into, “especially now,” according to Cameron. But she is   well on her way— she’s been playing all of her cards right.<img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">After graduation, Cameron took a leap   and took an offer in New York City to study at the Fashion Institute   of Technology. “The transition was a major change,” she says. For   Cameron the move was “exciting, overwhelming, stressful, and eye opening.”    New York, being one of the fashion hubs of the world, was definitely   not Madison. “More than anything, [it was] a change of pace,” she   says. “It was a necessary transition. It gave me a genuine grasp of   what the fast paced fashion industry is all about.”</p>
        <p class="content">Cameron went into college thinking   she wanted to be an orthopedic surgeon, but something at orientation   changed her mind. “As soon as I saw the design programs offered at   UW, my mind quickly changed,” Cameron says. “I gave it a shot and   fell in love. The idea of being a designer was confirmed after a month   I spent abroad in London at the prestigious, school of art and design,   Central Saint Martins.”<img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/jessieclothes.jpg" alt="jessieclothes" width="230" height="378" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">At 22 years old, she’s been in love   with designing for four years. Her classes with the Textile Arts Program   at UW-Madison were the building blocks for her education at FIT. The   smaller program at UW, despite being “an amazing education that instilled   a hard work ethic and time management,” according to Cameron, couldn’t   satiate her hunger for more. By attending FIT, Cameron was able to receive   an entirely design focused education. She went from taking a mere three   design classes a semester at UW, to taking seven design classes a semester   at FIT.  </p>
        <p class="content">“AT FIT, I was battling multiple   projects at a time and truly experienced the fast paced atmosphere,   and no sleep schedule,” Cameron said.</p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/jessiecoat.jpg" alt="jessiecoat" width="234" height="504" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />Sleep must’ve been a hard thing to   come by, especially considering Cameron also had a high profile internship   with the Textile and Design Manager for Issac Mizrahi’s company. Cameron   explains that as an intern she was given a lot of responsibility where   she was able take away an abundance of knowledge and lessons from the   fashion trade.</p>
        <p class="content"> “I learned the importance of   respect… to anyone and everyone.  Respect, respect, respect,” Cameron   says. “I learned the value of efficiency in terms of both time and   accuracy, the correct way to ask questions and to communicate, [and]   how to be professional and memorable.”</p>
        <p class="content">Cameron was memorable all right, after   nearly 5 months of working at Issac Mizrahi, people had their eyes and   ears out for job opportunities for her. Cameron’s connections with   the team, helped point her in the right direction. Cameron now finds   herself learning the other side of the Fashion Industry—sales. </p>
        <p class="content">She is currently a sales assistant   with the swimwear company, Raj Manufacturers, where she assists the   sales representatives in their day to day tasks, prepares and creates   swimwear lines and presentations for buyers, and of course, makes sure   to keep the showroom tidy and presentable. </p>
        <p class="content">“I do not exactly know what’s next   for me. Will it be sales?  Will it be design?  I do not know,” Cameron   says. “What I hope for is to make a connection with the Raj Manufacturing   design team in Tustin, CA and give swimwear design a shot.”</p>
        <p class="content">Cameron is seeking inspiration, and   gathering research to get started on a future swimwear collection, and <em> finally</em> be able to explore the city. What better place could you   find for inspiration than New York? </p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/mg[1].jpg" alt="mg" width="217" height="319" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />That is one of the same reasons that   Canadian designer Marie Genevieve Cyr came to the States. “It moves   constantly,” Cyr says. “There is so much to do, to see—it’s   really exciting. I love to be surrounded by new things and new people   every day.”</p>
        <p class="content">Cyr, 27, discovered her “passion   for fashion” at the age of 15, and has been designing for five years   on and off. She is presently working on getting her Masters Degree in   Visual Culture and Fashion Theory at New York University. Cyr   knew she wanted to further her education after finishing her degree   at Edinburgh in Canada because of how important education is to her. </p>
        <p class="content">“I knew I was going to do a Masters   in the following years,” Cyr says. “I was looking for something more   academic.  I searched for a long time and finally discovered this program   at New York University…a mix of art and fashion—clothing theory.”</p>
        <p class="content"> <img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/mgdress.jpg" alt="mgdress" width="267" height="342" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />Her current inspirations derived from   visual culture, are taking her design aesthetic to an entirely new level,   where she is experimenting with wearable electronic art. Cyr also finds   herself inspired by new technologies, and costumes, which have earned   her various accolades including, being nominated for a Genie Award by   the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television for “Best Costume Design,”   winning the Young fashion designer talent award by BSD, Shanghai, where   her outfit was exhibited in Shanghai and presented at Montreal fashion   week, and she was selected to create an art-fashion piece for an exhibition   at the Linen Museum of Portneuf in Canada. </p>
        <p class="content">She says she likes designing both clothing   and costumes, “as long as they aren’t mass produced.” Last August   she finished up a year contract with Cirque de Soleil working as a costume   maker and cutter for their Delirium, Zumanity, and Macau shows. Cyr   has also dabbled in costuming for films. She interned in the costume   department for the film, <em>A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints </em> [2006, Belladonna Productions] and <em>Mr. Brooks</em> [2007, MGM].        </p>
