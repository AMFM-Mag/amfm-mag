      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4">I</span>n Mike Hoffmann’s<span class="style4"> Perked Nation</span>, the world is his canvas, and any and everything around him is potentially a future piece of work. The twenty-six year old artist living in Sacramento, California, also goes by his art alias, Dr. Perked, the perkulator of his own clothing brand he created to showcase what happens when art and fashion collide.<img src="../images/issue 2/mikehoffmann/mikeshirt.jpg" alt="mikeshirt" width="315" height="534" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p>“My art and clothes are bound together like the ink pressed into the fabric of my shirts,” Hoffmann says. “I perk out anything and everything around me: paper, stickers, electronics, walls, my desk, shoes, the bottom of hats, street signs--everything is a canvas. Here in the perked lab my team and I put the freshest artwork onto clothing and treat everyone like a canvas.”</p>
        <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/mikehoffmann/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="252" height="162" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></span>So what exactly is perking? It’s like going up to a wall and writing “______ was here,” only with Hoffmann and the Perked team’s artistic touch. Hoffmann can “perk” in a number of different ways, by pencil, brush, or screen. He started drawing in sixth grade, and learned to paint and do silk screen in high school. He has also dabbled in print making and photography, and he says his next venture is filmmaking.</p>
        <p>When you see art through the eyes of Hoffmann, you are watching his life unfold on the canvas before you.“I live through my art, expressing it through color and emotion,” Hoffmann says. “I paint my life and live my dreams.”</p>
<p>Every piece that Hoffmann makes is potentially a live piece. No piece of work is ever truly finished. He has been known to work on a piece sporadically over time, building upon it layer by layer. The pieces evolve as his life evolves.</p>
        <p>Hoffmann remembers the first time he put an image on a piece of clothing. He used a computer transfer and put the image on upside down. He later learned the silk screening technique from a high school teacher, who helped him make four screens that he would use continually. </p>
        <p>“I was hella juiced to put my artwork on my clothing,” Hoffmann explains. “A bum in a shopping cart, a dollar bill that read United States of Corruption, a small bottle wrapped in a dollar bill and a power cord with a condom inside. I used these four screens for three years.”</p>
        <p> <img src="../images/issue 2/mikehoffmann/perked3.jpg" alt="perked" width="275" height="387" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Those were the early days for this artist who now has &quot;around 237&quot; silk screens that he works with now. A large aspect of his work are those 237 silk screens which at any given moment could wind up being used in a piece, as are any of the drawing and doodles in his stacks of sketchbooks. </p>
        <p> “I make art because it is the only thing that makes sense to me in this world,” Hoffmann says. “My art consumes me. I have acquired 21 sketchbooks over the years.” Even in corresponding with him through written word, you’ll find doodles and drawings next to words used to mimic his thoughts. </p>
        <p>Those beginning pieces are some of his most eye catching and popular designs at Perked Nation. He insists that his work isn’t attempting to take a political stance or trying to start anything other than a clothing and at revolution.</p>
        <p> “I’m not trying to address specific issues in my work,” he says.“I create what I feel is beautiful. The content of my work consists of my life and the culture that surrounds me.”<img src="../images/issue 2/mikehoffmann/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="168" height="279" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
<p> When Hoffmann describes some of the biggest inspirations behind his work, he describes music as a “mad influence,” particularly reggae and hip-hop. He lists some artists he’s into: Andy Warhol, Basquiat, Wayne Thiebaud, and David Choe.  But above all life, and all that comes with it, is his main inspiration, “partying, dreams, color, soul and style,” he says.</p>
        <p>The cities surrounding him are surely some the most beautiful influences on his work. One of his pieces is a large paintingand print of the San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. He somehow managed to catch the vibrancy of the city, and it’s people. Faces upon faded faces are layered surrounding the bridge, and of course a couple of “perked” stamps of approval.</p>
        <p>Hoffmann plans to perk the world. “Having these years to experiment with different mediums, images, color, durability, and style has made me the artist I am today who is able to create some of the most fresh, unique, vibrant, rebellious, soulful, and irresistible flavored clothing in California and soon the world,” he says. </p>
        <p>You’ve officially been perked...</p>
