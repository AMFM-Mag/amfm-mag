      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br />
        <span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/davidphoto.jpg" alt="david" width="300" height="199" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />P</span>eople like David Tracy. As a sophomore in college at the University of California-Los Angeles, you’d think Tracy’s dorm room would be decked out with his LEGO tables and lamps. Nope, that’s something he reserves for his home in Sacramento with his family.</p>
        <p>“I’m too afraid to keep my competed pieces here, I ultimately bring them home where they are much safer,” Tracy says. “If you visit my parents’ house in Sacramento, you’ll probably see what you’re expecting my dorm room to look like.  You can’t walk into a room without seeing something made out of LEGOs.”</p>
        <p>Tracy began getting noticed for his lego designs when he participated in the Sacramento’s artist studio tours at the Sacramento Center for Contemporary Art. Most of his LEGO designs are functional pieces like lamps and tables.</p>
        <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/lumens.jpg" alt="lumens" width="237" height="161" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></span>So it was only fitting when the owner of Lumen’s Light + Living, a light fixture and furniture store with an artistic edge, saw Tracy’s green LEGO lamp base on display. He liked it enough to come to Tracy’s “studio” which was essentially Tracy’s home with his parents, and offer him the opportunity to sell his work at the store.</p>
        <p>Having been away at school studying accounting while the public was responding to his work, Tracy didn’t get to see his work on display. “I set up the show at Lumens before I left for the spring quarter, and now my parents will be taking it down before I will be able to go and check it out,” he says. “I had wanted to be a fly on the wall and hear what people were thinking, but unfortunately, being at UCLA prevented me from doing so.”</p>
<p>Although the sales reports may have given the impression that his work went unnoticed, that certainly is not the case. Tracy has been hearing nothing but positive feedback on his LEGO lamps and designs. Each lamp has been someone’s favorite. </p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/tracypullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="228" height="269" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />People may have been taken aback at the fact that they are investing so much in a lamp made of toys, made by a college kid, but Tracy hopes to break that misconception. He wants to show people that LEGOs are much more than a toy. But, he knows beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/yellowlamp.jpg" alt="yellowlamp" width="191" height="446" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />“I am building because I love to do it, not because I expect to make money, if that was my intention, I’d be failing pretty badly,” Tracy says. “I would be making these sculptures even if not for the business, so whatever attention they attract is an added bonus.”</p>
        <p>Tracy says he has been sculpting with LEGOs since he was six years old, but he didn’t get serious about it until he was older and made his first lamp. His mom was the main catalyst behind him doing something more with his sculpting after seeing bucket upon bucket of old the used toys collecting dust. She told him lightly that he should make furniture with them, and he did just that, and enjoyed it so much he’s spent his entire life savings on LEGOs. </p>
        <p>The more complex the piece, the more LEGOs needed. He said he just spent roughly $1,200 on LEGOs for a globe piece he is working on. The yellow lamp alone is about 20,000 pieces, a project he says took him a little over two days to create. As complex as it looks with the criss crossing and x-shape, he insists it was easier than it looks, especially in comparison to his Black Torus Lamp. </p>
        <p>“The black torus shaped lamp was the most technically challenging piece I have made so far.  I faced a number of challenges,” Tracy explains. “I generally build a preliminary attempt at the structure I want, then study what parts of the shape don’t look or feel right, and then tear down those parts to rework them. Since I am a perfectionist, I sometimes have to rework the sculpture several times.”</p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/david1.jpg" alt="torus" width="220" height="311" hspace="5" align="left" />Tracy does all of his creating brick by brick, relying only on his instinct on where to place the next square. He saves sketching for jotting down a quick idea for later, or to visually show someone what he is envisioning. He says he only puts about 20 seconds of effort into the actual thinking process, he’d rather get to building, and he has the calluses to prove it. He keeps reworking a piece until he feels it’s done, then he begins the gluing process.</p>
        <p>“LEGOs take a very long time to construct, tear apart, and remold,” Tracy says, but nonetheless he loves them. “I love the colors, and the lighthearted feeling of the final product. There is also something quite satisfying about designing any kind of shape out of square pieces.”</p>
        <p>Tracy says he has always loved LEGOs, and he will continue to love them, insisting his age has nothing to do with it. He would have started the same business had he been 40 years old. As a young artist and adult, his career and life is just beginning. He has a Australia six-month venture ahead of him, hopes of applying to the UCLA Architecture School next year, and of course, more LEGO sculpting. </p>
        <p>“The only thing that’s definite about my future is more LEGO related calluses.” he said. And on lives the LEGO art movement...</p>
