Miike Snow is not one person, it is a band    of Swedes that has brought their rockin’ fun pop music to an iPod  near you. Their songs embed themselves into your brain for  days and almost become a soundtrack for our  lives.  Their single “Animal,” from their self-titled debut, <em>Miike Snow</em>, is reminiscent of Flaming Lips past meets Animal  Collective. &quot;I change shapes just to  hide in this place but I’m still, I’m still an animal,&quot; speaks to the ever-changing society that we live  in and the different phases of life we experience. Listeners will find solace in listening to the album because  of its light take on life, and lyrics  that speak to our young hearts. </span></p>

<p class="style4">4. <strong>Animal Collective</strong>, Meriweather Post Pavilion</p>

The fact that they are rarely visually seen adds to the  allure of the oddities of a wonderfully  mastered album. They are known for making experimental music that is highly progressive. <em>MeriWeather Post  Pavilion </em>is the band’s eighth studio album, and this album has received nothing but acclaim as one of the best  albums of the year, before the  year was even over. It definitely kicked off a year to great music because it came out right at the beginning of January.  &quot;My Girls&quot; is the epitome of the magic behind the  album. You’ll find yourself walking around the fantasy world that Animal  Collective has created for you, and  loving every minute of it against all odds. </p>

<p class="style4">3. <strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong>, It’s Blitz</p>
<img src="images/Albums/yyy.jpg" alt="yyy" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">T</span><span class="content">he Yeah Yeah Yeahs came back following their 2006 album <em>Show Your Bones</em> and their 2007 released EP <em>Is Is</em>. <em>It’s Blitz</em>, although a different sound than their previous albums is still the Yeah Yeah Yeahs at their greatest. It really shows how the band can reinvent themselves, yet still be good. They are following what’s popular in music at the moment and adding their personal YYY flavor to the mix. Karen O shines through on this album with her cool nature and ability to bring the songs alive. When listening you can image the essence of O in every word that she says. Songs like &quot;Zero&quot; and &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot; are dance anthems, while songs like &quot;Hysteric&quot; and &quot;Skeletons&quot; are melancholying happy and nostalgic.</span>

<p><span class="style4">2. <strong>Metric</strong>, Fantasies</span></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/metric.jpg" alt="metric" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">M</span><span class="content">etric’s album <em>Fantasies</em> was a close  runner up for first place. This album pumps you up and then eases you down, with beautiful songs like &quot;Gimme  Sympathy,&quot; matched against songs like  &quot;Sick Muse.&quot; Emily Haines’ voice speaks to your soul, injecting the music into your veins, and into a cataclysmic Metric  state. You could hear the fucking through the wall  that Haines describes in &quot;Satellite Mind.&quot; The drums and the repetition of  satellite mind mixed with Ooo, Ooos,  is like an adrenaline rush— as is the song &quot;Gold Gun Girls,&quot; which kicks off intensely with the guitar and  drums, like a gunshot to your ears. With,&quot;All the gold and the guns in the  world couldn’t get you off/ All the gold and the guns and the girls couldn’t get you off, and the  chorus “Is it ever gonna be enough?” repeating, playing  the song just once is never enough. You always want more and more, and the same is true for the album. </span></p>
<p class="content">[GOLD GUN  GIRLS]</p>
<p><span class="style4">1. <strong>Phoenix</strong>, Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</span></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/phoenix.jpg" alt="phoenix" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">P</span><span class="content">hoenix’s album <em>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</em> has as much to offer as the great composer  himself, Mozart. This being the French rock band’s sixth album, they have quite a bit under their belts. Their song &quot;1901&quot;  was a hit this year, and was featured in a series  of Cadillac commercials, and even landed a Grammy nomination for the stellar track. This is a happy tune—and your body  will not be able to resist moving to the guitar  and keyboard backing this song. Their album is uniquely fresh and  raw, and there is joy bursting from each  track. “Love Like a Sunset” really showcases their instrumental talent as musicians. This nearly 8 minute  song takes you on a journey through an energetic  mix through the ultimate jam session. The combination of different morphing melodies is like the emotional rollercoaster  you feel when in love. The buildup is momentous  and satisfying once you get there. It’s got this Radiohead intensity to it, with only half the darkness and oddity,  more in the spirit of Coldplay. They keep topping themselves with each album, growing more mature and recognized  with each one. </span>          </p>
