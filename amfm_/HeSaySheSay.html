    <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="content"><span class="style4">T</span>here’s more to <strong>He Say She Say</strong> than   a Lupe Fiasco song. He Say She Say is on top of the world—the Sears   Tower that is. The duo consisting of Chicago’s beloved <strong>Million Dollar   Mano</strong> and Girl Wonder <strong>Drea Smith </strong>are fresh to death, exuding that young   Chicago cool. So cool Fiasco took note and brought them aboard the Chicago   talent train. <img src="images/HeSaySheSay/manodrea.jpg" alt="manodrea" width="417" height="284" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
      <p class="content">He Say She Say has spent the past two   years touring around the world with Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West’s <em> Glow in the Dark </em>Tour, performing at Lollapalooza for two consecutive   summers, doing gigs, making ends meet, and having fun along the way.   Young, talented, and hungry, He Say She Say is paving the way with their   hip-rock vibe, fusing together a variety of different styles and influences. </p>
      <p class="content"><img src="images/HeSaySheSay/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />“I think me and Mano's music is progressive   because it’s a hybrid of so many genres,” Smith says. “There is   no real way to classify [it] because it’s bits and pieces of everything   we love about music,” she said. Smith classifies their music as “intelligent   pop music,” as it is a mix of punk, electro, rock and new wave. When   you hit up a He Say She Say concert and find yourself dancing to their   hit song, &quot;Crash Dummie,&quot; you may just find yourself thinking while you   dance. </p>
      <p class="content">Smith finds inspiration in “exaggerated   experiences of her own” and the lives of others when writing lyrics.   &quot;Crash Dummie&quot; is about “a girl who is getting played by a guy, and   she knows it, yet she allows him to continue to emotionally treat her   like a crash dummy,&quot; Smith explains and sings in the lyrics “I’m   just your crash, mash dummy, that you bash in your back seat.” </p>
      <p class="content"><img src="images/HeSaySheSay/manodj.jpg" alt="manodj" width="265" height="322" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />Some people have found the preceding   lyrics to be a bit provocative, but Smith is just keeping it real. “I   think it’s funny—I’m an angel,” she says and pauses laughing.    “But really I’m just being honest.  I’m sure a lot of women   my age think the way I do and just don’t know how to or don’t want   to say it,” she says. The song is backed with an electro beat   with a killer vibe rather than just a tight beat. </p>
      <p class="content"> “I love how a good song can   make u feel,” Smith says. “I like when something's catchy, but still   intelligent. Our music makes people think because I talk about real   life stuff, almost poetically. I love good lyrics and saying things   in a way that it hasn’t been said before. I try to be smart and clever   without being too obscure,” she said. </p>
      <p class="content">A lot of the music today is dominated   by hip hop, but He Say She Say is finding inspiration against the grain.   They even do a Foo Fighter’s cover of “Everlong,” which further   explains the duo’s unconventional nature. “People assume Mano and   I are a hip hop duo because we're coming up in a scene that is dominated   by a new wave of hip hop,” Smith says. “A lot of music I hear now   is the new wave of hip hop, we aren’t doing hip hop music, even thought   we love it, that’s not what this project is about,” Smith explains. <img src="images/HeSaySheSay/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
      <p class="content">This project is all about one thing—innovation.   When He Say She Say first got together they were more hip hop focused,   but as they matured as artists and began experimenting, they began pushing   toward a more indie sound—legit rock band included. It was really   important for them to create their own individuality rather than “doing   some eclectic R&amp;B shit,” according to Mano. </p>
      <p class="content">“We’re not just revamped versions   of old things,” Mano says. “We wanted to put our own individuality   on a spin of what they probably did back then, but still re-freshen   it to make it new for what is now,” Mano said. Kind of like the current   scene in music, which Smith finds reminiscent of New York in the 80’s. </p>
      <p class="content">“The punk and rock kids are at the   same parties as the fly hip hop kids, and we're all enjoying the same   music together,” Smith says. “We piggy back off each other its cool,”   she said. Although neither Smith nor Mano grew up in the peak of the   80’s, it’s hard not to make that connection.  This is the new   80’s—a time when the musical masses are merging, and the cool kids   at the top of their game can’t help but hang out.</p>
      <p class="content">You know when music culture has become   a hybrid when Lil Wayne is doing a collaboration with Madonna and Weezer,   or when Jay-Z performs with Coldplay and U2, or when T-Pain can change   the face of all mainstream music with two words—auto tune. “When   the radio and the media like one thing, they’re set on manufacturing   that one thing into a continuous route until everybody is tired of it   and they want something new,” Mano explains. “And then with that   new thing, they do the same thing,” he says. <img src="images/HeSaySheSay/drea.jpg" alt="drea" width="325" height="521" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
      <p class="content">Being based out of Chicago, there could   be a lot of pressure to measure up against the likes of Kanye West,   Lupe Fiasco, Common, and Kid Sister—all Chicago bred talent. But for   He Say She Say, there is no intimidation there. Smith doesn’t feel   the need to prove herself, explaining that music is like her right arm.   “We are all so different,” she says. “Everyone here has drive,   at least my direct peers do. They inspire me to go harder,” she said.   Especially one direct peer—the <em>he </em> of He Say She Say, Mano. </p>
      <p class="content">Mano has been showing Smith the ropes,   and the ins and outs of the music business to help mold her into the   best artist she can be, whether it be by making music, exposing her   to the scene, or helping her <em>be seen</em> with gifts like her Alexander   Wang shoes that are eye candy wherever they go.  Mano certainly   has an eccentric style to go with his eccentric taste in music. When   amfm talked to the duo, he was wearing a pair of Nike dunks that were   two different colors—one turquoise and one candy apple red, both with   gold trim. After a bit of chiding, he insisted the shoes came mismatched.   His style as well as his music is always on point.</p>
      <p class="content">“Mano is the fresher one,” Smith   says. “He pulls from old sounds and new, and he is just a fly dude.   I’m a smidge grimier and I love a lot of old punk and jazz singers,”   she says.  Smith is obsessed with Blondie and Debbie Harry, calling   her “the epitome of a rock star.” Her other musical muses are Billie   Holiday, Chrissie Hynde and Siouxsie Sioux to name a few. “Chrissie   Hynde is an amazing guitar player and has such a unique tone and quality   to her voice, but you can feel every emotion that Billie Holiday is   feeling in all of her music,” Smith says. “And Siouxsie Sioux had   the coolest eerie presence about herself. She was dark but still had   pop appeal.  I guess I just want to embody those elements from those   women,” she said.</p>
      <p class="content">Smith feels that with his fly attitude,   and her old school influences, they are able to complement each other   as a group. Smith still has more to learn she admits. Mano has been   in the game far longer, and expresses a greater “pop sensibility”   than she does.</p>
