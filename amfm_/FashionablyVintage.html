      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4">I</span>t takes an eclectic flair and eye   for fashion trends to learn the ins and outs of vintage re-sale. These   vintage re-sale stores aren’t your average Goodwill. They are full   blown vintage boutiques that specialize in gathering the coolest of   the cool finds and one-of- a- kind closet treasures that you won’t   find at the mall. These stores are taking vintage fashion to the next   level with style. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/cuffs.jpg" alt="cuffs" width="346" height="365" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="content">D</span>own in the heart of Midtown, lies   the heart of Sacramento. There in the midst of the art and music driven   community lies vintage and re-sale store, <strong>Cuffs</strong>. Owner and founder,   Lacadia Olsen says she couldn’t have picked a better place to open   Cuffs.</p>
        <p class="content"> We participate in Sacramento's   Second Saturday Art Walk every month, all year long,” Olsen says.   “Every second Saturday of the month the businesses within downtown   and midtown Sacramento have the opportunity to host an artist's work   and throw an opening reception. It's almost always our best day in sales   for the month and we've become fairly well known for hosting a good   show.”</p>
        <p class="content">Usually backed by a good band or DJ,   Olsen says people from all over the area come down to check out the   art, buy handcrafted items from street vendors, sample local restaurants,   and shop the boutiques. But hosting a good party isn’t the only thing   Cuffs is known for. They were voted best women’s boutique in SN&amp;R’s   Best of Sacramento, and placed 2nd for best vintage store. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote1" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">It was really exciting and I was surprised   to be honest,” Olsen says. “It really felt like an accomplishment   to win for best women's boutique. It's good to know that people like   what I'm doing and that my concept is resonating with so many.” </p>
        <p class="content">Olsen felt that she was headed toward   a career in journalism, but had always had an interest in fashion, and   had often thrown around the idea of opening a vintage boutique. She   had always envisioned “turning affordable, thrift store items into   something that translated into a wearable, fashion-forward look” of   her own.  </p>
        <p class="content">“I love that vintage can be reinvented   over and over and that you never can tell what trend will resurface,”   Olsen explains.</p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/cuffsguy2.jpg" alt="cuffsguy" width="210" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />“I love the hunt and I love the rush   that comes with finding something really fantastic.  And I love having   a shop so that even if that fantastic piece doesn't fit me, I can show   it to someone who it will,” she says. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/cuffsgirl.jpg" alt="cuffsgirl" width="187" height="227" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">These types of stores cool new vintage   shops with a spin are very popular on the west coast. Olsen says her   aim was to not have the store appear as your typical thrift store, and   almost create this sense of community within itself.  Olsen was   inspired by two stores in Santa Barbara, and befriended them before   relocating to Sacramento, running her idea by them.  She was impressed   by “how well organized it was presented and merchandised, which most   thrift store are not. Cuffs looks like a retail store, with jeans folded   and displayed, accessories, purses and hats strategically placed. Most   thrifts stores smell like Grandma’s closet, and are more like cluttered   closets, than actual stores. </p>
        <p class="content">For such a small place, Cuffs is doing   big things. Olsen also incorporates new clothing inspired by looks and   trends from the past, which makes up about half of their sales. Shoppers   rave about Cuffs in their online reviews, some saying that they can   never walk in without walking out with something. The store has a wide   variety of quality and unique clothing that offers a broad spectrum   of styles waiting for that special someone to come along.  </p>
        <p class="content">Besides offering unique and one-of-a-kind   items, Cuffs is locally and family owned and run.  “We're often praised   for our customer service, which I think is really important and should   be seen as a benefit to shopping locally,” Olsen says. “I think   our regular customers really feel at home in our shop.  We know most   of them by name and they know that we'll help them find whatever they   may need.”<img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/cuffsguy.jpg" alt="cuffsguy" width="202" height="227" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">Buying is one of Olsen’s favorite   aspects of the job, and she likes to incorporate her employees into   the process, asking them for their advice on what to look for, or opinions   on certain pieces she’s found at thrift stores, or estate and yard   sales. Olsen is all about individual style, and believes that vintage   will always be fashionable. </p>
        <p class="content">Something vintage from some era, will   always be back in style, because it's more affordable and more accessible   than ever before,” Olsen says. “Incorporating vintage pieces into   one's wardrobe is practically imperative when it comes to achieving   personal style.”</p>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4">F</span>or Madison, Wisconsin’s <strong>Good   Style Shop</strong>, the name of their store didn’t come from offering   clothing with good style. Owners Indra Dunis, and Aaron Coyes opened   the store after seeing success selling items on e-Bay. </p>
        <p class="content">“When I traveled to East Asia, it   was like a saying where if you carried yourself and presented yourself   well in social situations they'd be like ‘good style!’ It has nothing   to do with clothes,” Coyes explains. Dunis interjects elaborating,   “Or if something is kind of cool, we've adopted that phrase –we'd   say good style,” she explains. “When we decided to open a shop we   decided to call it that naturally. Good style is just your own personal   style really.”<img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/goodstyle.jpg" alt="goodstyle" width="566" height="323" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">Coming from the west coast, Dunis and   Coyes were inspired by the vintage stores in San Francisco. Initially   they wanted to own a free performance space where artists could come   and showcase their music and do shows, and now their store is that exact   place. Dunis and Coyes also double up as musicians in their band, Peaking   Lights, so incorporating music and art into the store was a given. </p>
        <p class="content">“We wanted the shows to be free,   we wanted it to be all ages, but when you do that you can’t really   make any money, so we needed to have a business too, so it kind of just   worked out,” Dunis explains. “When we were selling stuff online   we could do that when we were in town, but now we can sort of have a   space to invite our friends who are musicians to come perform,” she   said. <span class="content1"><img src="images/buttons/copyright.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="36" align="right" /></span></p>
