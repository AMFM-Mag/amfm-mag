      <p><strong>Ibeyi: Lincoln Hall</strong><br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr">There is something spiritual and ritualistic about the Cuban, French sisters of Ibeyi. Ibeyi, which means &ldquo;twins&rdquo; in yoruba, played to a sold out audience at Lincoln Hall. Their music is hauntingly beautiful, so much so that the ancestors were definitely in the room that evening. Lisa-Kaind√© Diaz and Naomi Diaz emerged on stage in all black and began their set singing their intro, &ldquo;Elegua&rdquo; acoustically, an ancient Yoruba Oricha, or manifestation of God, in perfect sopranic harmony before lighting two candles, seemingly an offering and tradition for them before a set. </p>
The two were breathtaking and all smiles, despite the heavy nature of their debut self titled album, which is dedicated to their famous Cuban musician father of Buena Vista Social Club who they lost at the young age of 11, and their older sister who died two years ago from an aneurysm. This seeps out in songs like &ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lost in my Mind&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mama Says&rdquo; which were their opening songs. <br />
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;My ghosts are not gone,&rdquo; Lisa sang over a hip hop electronic laden beat Naomi dropped on her drum machine and her Cajon, a wooden square drum box, which she said she began playing the day her father passed away. With Lisa&rsquo;s airy, ethereal voice, and Naomi using her body as a percussion instrument by slapping her heart, snapping and tapping the cajon, &ldquo;Mama Says&rdquo; brought the ghosts to life. &nbsp;</p>
The two appeared humble, yet regal with beams of light like halos above their head, stating to the crowd that they want to spread the knowledge of ancient Yoruba tradition through their music. The audience was still and in wonder when the music was mystic, like during the eerie loops of &ldquo;Oya&rdquo; and clapped in unison with them throughout &ldquo;I&rsquo;m On My way&rdquo; when there was a break the rhythm of the piano and drum. They pretended they didn&rsquo;t know what song was next as they began dropping the bass of their popular hit &ldquo;River,&rdquo; but they didn&rsquo;t fool the crowd one bit, and everyone began dancing and cheering with enthusiasm. <br />
<p dir="ltr">They also did a beautiful rendition of rapper Jay Electronica&rsquo;s &ldquo;Better in Tune with the Infinite,&rdquo; before noticing the set of twins in the audience and dedicating their final song &ldquo;Ibeyi&rdquo; to them, ending their set just as they had begun, acoustically, bare voiced. The two returned for an encore, singing &ldquo;River&rdquo; one last time, and stating that they would definitely be back again. The two even stayed to sell and sign records and take pictures with a long line of fans. This wasn&rsquo;t just a concert, it was definitely a transcendental experience leaving our ears and our souls changed for having been there.</p>
