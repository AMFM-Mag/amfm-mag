a busy month creating the first issue of <strong>amfm: </strong><strong><em>arts. </em></strong><em><strong>music. </strong><strong>fashion.</strong><strong> magazine. </strong></em>I hope you have become as artistically, musically, and fashionably inclined as I have creating  the articles for this month. From spending a weekend in Chicago being  part of He Say She Say's entourage, to discovering new vintage finds  and rising designers and artists, it has been a ride.
I would  like to give a special thanks to everyone involved in the making of  this magazine and all of the great people I spoke with to create the  articles you are reading in this issue. A big thank you to Mark Riechers  for his amazing technical support. </p>
                  <p class="content">As you peruse the website  check out 13 great articles on some of our favorite fashion causes,  music, and artists. As the year comes to an end, <strong>amfm</strong> looked back to  some of the <strong><a href="Albumsof2009.html">best albums of 2009</a></strong><a href="Albumsof2009.html">.</a> See if some of your favorites made the  top 20 and listen to the song picks from the albums on our listening  page. <strong><a href="HeSaySheSay.html">He Say She Say</a></strong> and <strong><a href="SleepingInTheAviary.html">Sleeping in the Aviary</a></strong> should definitely be  added to your 2010 music library! Check out our features on them in  <a href="musicpage.html"><strong>music</strong></a>. <br />

                    I talked to three up and coming designers and found out  everything from what inspires them to what makes them tick. These are  going to be the next fashion divas behind the runway minus the diva  attitude. There are some people taking fashion to the next level. In  our <strong><a href="clothes.html">&quot;Clothes with a Cause&quot;</a> </strong>article we feature four different apparel  companies that are creating clothes for the greater good. If you think  thats good, take a look at some of our everyday fashion models in our  <a href="SceneNStyle.html"><strong>&quot;Scene N' Style&quot;</strong></a> lookbook.<br />
                    <br />
                    Make sure you &quot;discover&quot; Nancy  Hoffman in our<strong> <a href="Undiscovered.html">&quot;Undiscovered&quot;</a> </strong>article in the arts section. We've got  all kinds of art for you this month. We've got Warhol; we've got  photography; we've got tattoos and even blood! Yes, blood...Even if it  creeps you out a little bit, check out the article on <strong><a href="TrevinPrince.html">Trevin Prince</a></strong> and  his unconvential art medium. Talent runs in his veins.<br />
