      <p class="style4">amfm's 20 ALBUMS OF 2009 (16 thru 20)</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="content"><span class="style4">W</span>hether you bought them, downloaded them, or pirated them (which hopefully you did not), these albums were “must hear” music from the past year.&nbsp; <strong>amfm </strong>looks back at some of the best albums of 2009. Who knows what 2010 will bring? Surely another slew of great music to saturate your inner musical airwaves. </p>
<p><span class="style4"><strong>20. John Mayer, Battle  Studies</strong></span></p>
          <p><span class="content"><img src="images/Albums/johnmayer.jpg" alt="johnmayer" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /></span><span class="style4">B</span><span class="content">efore John Mayer became known for  breaking up and making up with actress Jennifer  Aniston, (and every other chick) he made great music, and he has  since returned to his  musical roots,  taking the lessons he's learned in life and love, and has put it in his music  in his fourth album, <em>Battle Studies</em>—his “ode to pop.” Mayer says the  album &quot;incorporates a lot  of the lessons, a lot of the observations, and a little bit of advice. Like a handbook, like a heartbreak  handbook.&quot; He must've learned a lot from past experiences if he can make an album that is an homage to a handbook  for getting your  heart broken. &quot;Half  of My Heart&quot; is a duet with Taylor Swift, and two of the songs were written by rock legends Robert Johnson,  and Bruce Springsteen--Mayer covers Robert  Johnson's  &quot;Crossroads,&quot; and Bruce Springsteen's &quot;I'm on Fire.&quot; This  album is definitely a different  kind of John Mayer, he takes chances with this album resulting in an intimate 46 minutes that are the best of  his entire career. &quot;Who Says,&quot; the first single from <em>Battle Studies</em> was well received,  despite a little controversy over the lyrics, &quot;Who says I can't get stoned?&quot; Mayer  cleared that one up saying  that  he intended for it to be seen as getting high on life, which  listeners everywhere can do by popping in Mayer's  CD. </span></p>

The Noisettes have been widely popular  in the UK and are on the brink of breaking out in the United States. Their  second single,  &quot;Don't Upset the Rhythm&quot; was well received and landed the band the opportunity to perform on late night and  daytime talk shows. Their music is a fun  divergence  from the mainstream music that is popular, and is known for their crazy live sets. Front woman, Shingai Shoniwa<strong>, </strong>is a stand out for her dramatic voice and demeanor.  The band will only get better over time, and will surely be showing up more in the States as they gain more and more  momentum in the year to come. </span></p>

Their album is a light take on life,  a theme Weezer is no stranger to. &quot;(If You're Wondering if I Want You To) I Want You To&quot; was the first  single from the album and the upbeat  tone illustrated the band's youthful outlook, despite having been around for so  long. The band has been busy promoting  their album and their most recent endeavor—Weezer  Snuggies, so you can snuggie up and relax in ratitude...</span></p>

<p><strong class="style4">17. Paramore, Brand New Eyes</strong></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/paramore.jpg" alt="paramore" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">D</span><span class="content">espite internal band turmoil, growing up, and fears of their third album not living up to their 2008 release<em> Riot!</em>, Paramore's most recent album<em> Brand New Eyes </em>is their best album yet. The album debuted on the Billboard charts at number two. The album title is alluding to the band trying not to let any setbacks hinder the reason they began making music in the first place by looking at the situation with brand new eyes. &quot;Brick by Boring Brick&quot; alludes to a longing for innocence as the band is growing up in the midst of stardom. The fledgling band and front woman Hayley Williams, have matured since their last CD and it shines through in the tracks. &quot;The Only Exception&quot; is one of the albums best songs. &quot;And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love if it does not exist/ But darlin' you/are/ the only exception.&quot; Williams' voice is smooth and mellow, the guitar is soothing, almost like a lullaby. It's truly a beautiful song. &quot;Misguided Ghosts&quot; is another example of how stunning Williams' is and how the band can make a total 180. The song is so pure and raw. You feel like Paramore is in the room with you--the guitar is right there, you can hear the fingers touch the strings. The song &quot;Ignorance&quot; reflects a summer spent touring with No Doubt, alluding to rhythm of No Doubt's &quot;Excuse Me Mister&quot; from <em>Tragic Kingdom</em>. Paramore stands out from the rest of the band's in their genre and most of it has to do with sheer talent, energy and the amazing Williams. </span></p>

<p class="content"><strong><span class="style4">&nbsp;16. Rihanna, Rated R </span></strong></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/rihanna.jpg" alt="rihanna" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">W</span><span class="content">ith the November release of her  newest album <em>Rated R, </em>the wait was finally over for   pop and R&amp;B princess, Rihanna, to make her  way back to the limelight. Following the success  of her previous album, <em>Good Girl Gone Bad, </em>and bouncing back from the altercation with then boyfriend Chris  Brown,&nbsp;Rihanna prevails again. This album features a darker and edgier Rihanna(Yes, she could get more edgy.) It is a  representation of her emerging  from the darkness of a hiatus lasting months, and pouring that into her music. The album is layered with emotions,  and is a very personal look at the singer. &quot;Russian Roulette,&quot; which was written and  produced by Ne-Yo explores suicide and violence. The song begins with a haunting guitar and ends with a gunshot.  The album goes hard—there’s even a  song called “Hard,” where Rihanna sings about how she’s “so hard, too hard, too hard.” “Mad House,” an  interlude, is straight out of a horror movie. Wish it were a whole song…The album runs smooth as each track  transitions perfectly into the  next. She  also joins forces with Will.i.am, Young Jeezy, Slash and Justin Timberlake on the album.&nbsp; Rihanna has displayed  her ability to reinvent herself with each album, from &quot;Pon de Replay&quot; to &quot;Umbrella&quot; to songs  like &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; and &quot;The Wait is Ova,&quot; she has secured herself a spot on the top  yet again. Can't say the same for her ex... <br />
