        <p class="style4">amfm's 20 ALBUMS OF 2009 (11 thru 15)</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong><span class="style4">15. Kid Cudi, Man on the Moon</span></strong></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/kidcudi.jpg" alt="kidcudi" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">K</span><span class="content">id Cudi is the latest indie hip  hopper to hit the scene. He first piqued the interest of fans with his mixtape <em>A Kid Named  Cudi </em>released in 2008 to critical acclaim, and his  ability to mix hip hop with jazz, rock and  soul. He's worked alongside some of the godfather's  of genre infused music for <em>Man on the Moon</em>, Common and Kanye West, which he collaborated with to make the song, &quot;Make Her  Say.&quot; The song samples the acoustic version of Lady Gaga's &quot;Pokerface&quot; and  Common alludes to Jamie Foxx's &quot;Blame it on the Alcohol.&quot; The  video is like an indie flick, with a good  soundtrack. He also collaborates with MGMT and  Ratatat  on the track &quot;Pursuit of Happiness (Nightmare), which is also produced by   Ratatat, who makes another appearance in the  song, &quot;Alive (Nightmare).&quot; The album is set up in a series of five Acts, and is emotionally charged with  raw lyrics and vocals. The top single  from the album, &quot;Day N' Night&quot; skyrocketed to the top of the  Billboard charts, making the  album out of this world. </span></p>

<p><strong><span class="style4">14. Pearl Jam, Back Spacer</span></strong></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/pearljam.jpg" alt="pearljam" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">F</span><span class="content">ans saw a different Pearl Jam this  year, as the band strayed away from their signature  sound for their ninth studio album <em>BackSpacer</em>. Having worked  on tons of new material in 2008,  including some instrumentals and demo tracks, the band decided to incorporate that into their new album,  which has a new wave/pop sound. The songs are  short  and sweet, none of them over five minutes, unlike some of their past work where  the songs were almost like a jam fest.  Stand out tracks include &quot;The Fixer,&quot; and &quot;Amongst the Waves.&quot; The album fills out nicely with a  mixture of up-tempo songs and ballads.  Most of this shift in their sound comes from lead singer Eddie Vedder's <em>Into  the Wild Soundtrack</em> still running  through his veins. Vedder also says the election of President Obama also had an influence on the optimistic tone  of the album. The  significant change was  embraced widely by fans, and is one of the band's best later records. Although the band is a  veteran in the rock game, they are able to evolve creatively with the times and still produce music that people love  and want to hear.<br />

          <p><strong><span class="style4">13. Black Eyed Peas, The E.N.D</span></strong></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/BEP.jpg" alt="blackeyedpeas" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">T</span><span class="content">he Black Eyed Peas are back from Fergi's  solo stint, and Will.i.am's hardcore musical Obama  campaign. Their album, <em>The E.N.D </em>marked the beginning of musical sounds from the future. The Black Eyed Peas are so  3008 and everyone else is so 2000 and late, Will.i.am  even lost the <em>so passé</em> dreads for a shorter do. &quot;Boom Boom  Pow&quot; was definitely an  anthem this year, and &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; was the song everybody  played before a big night out.  BEP has stayed true to their musical roots--making music that showcases each member of the group's  individual talent, and music with a conscience. Their song &quot;One Tribe&quot; has got to stem from the  historical change our country went through with the election of President  Obama. &quot;One Tribe, one time, one planet,  one race/It’s all one blood, don't  care about your face/The color of your eye or the tone of your skin...Cause man I'm loving this peace&quot; and  we are loving this album!       </span></p>

          <p><strong><span class="style4">12. Beirut, March of the Zapotec and RealPeople Holland EP</span></strong></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/Beirut.jpg" alt="beirut" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="content">Zach Condon, the lead singer of  Beirut, brought his travels back with him to the studio. The <em>March of the Zapotec and RealPeople Holland EP </em>is  a two disc set, one containing the remnants&nbsp; of  Condon's trip to Oaxaca, Mexico with a 19-piece band from  Mexico backing Condon on <em>Zapotec</em>.  The Jimenez Band from the town of Teotitlán del Valle in Oaxaca really added a certain authenticity to the music. It  feels like you're an indie kid in Mexico, and you can experience the trip through the tracks.&quot;La Llorona,&quot;  one of the tracks, is based on a popular  legend told in most Spanish-speaking countries. Stand out tracks from the <em>Zapotec </em>half includes,  &quot;The Shrew,&quot; and &quot;My Wife.&quot;&nbsp; The other half of the EP, <em>Holland</em>, is  more  electronic and more removed from the Mexican theme of the first disc. &quot;My  Night with a Prostitute in  Marseilles,&quot; is one of best songs on <em>Holland.</em></span></p>

<p><span class="style4">11. <strong>Muse</strong>, The Resistance</span></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/muse.jpg" alt="muse" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">E</span><span class="content">nglish band, Muse, began their  invasion of the United States this year, despite having already established themselves quite awhile back. <em>The  Resistance</em> is the band's fifth album.  They performed on MTV for the Video Music Awards, and apparently it was their first time performing in the States. The  album was even more successful than their previous  album, <em>Black Holes and Revelations</em>. The album soared to the top in 19 countries and reached the third spot  on the Billboard charts. The album is classically driven, there is even a three-part, thirteen minute song,  &quot;Exogenesis: Symphony&quot; which is  very much like a symphony or concerto in the sound and the fact that over 40 musicians were involved in the recording  process. The album is on a grandeur scale than any  of their past albums, and perhaps it is become of their newfound success. &quot;Uprising,&quot; their first  single from the album definitely reflects that. </span></p>
