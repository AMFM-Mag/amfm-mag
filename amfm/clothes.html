        <p class="content"><em><strong>Give a little, Get a little. </strong></em></p>
        <p class="content"><strong><em>Get what you give.  </em></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><strong><em>One for one, one for all, help someone   live. </em></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><strong><em>Where   clothes are more than clothes, and   shoes are more than shoes. </em></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><strong><em>Wear clothes with a cause, where   giving is the muse!</em></strong></p>
        <p class="content">Shopping never felt better! Clothing   brands that are giving back are the newest form of donation. With items   like these, you can support grass root campaigns that help the world   at large, while making a fashion statement!</p>
        <p class="content"> <strong>amfm </strong> is singling out four of the top brands out there that are making clothes,   shoes, and accessories with a cause. From being added to the wardrobes   of everyday people, to being talked about on Ellen, and worn by numerous   celebrities, <strong>TOMS Shoes, OmniPeace, Defend New Orleans</strong> and <strong> American Apparel’s Legalize LA </strong> t-shirts are taking the world by storm—one sale at a time. </p>
        <p class="content"><strong><u>TOMS Shoes: </u></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/toms_shoes_logo.jpg" alt="tomslogo" width="413" height="257" hspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
<p class="content"><span class="style4">S</span>hoes are quite easy to come by in   the United States. We have countless stores devoted to them, closets   full of them, and electric wires decorated with them around the nation.   The idea of someone not having shoes is an idea that is hard to grasp,   but a grave reality for people in developing countries around the globe. </p>
        <p class="content">Shoes can be quite important when education   and amputation is on the line. For many children and people living in   developing countries, being barefoot is a way of life. Shoes protect   the feet from getting wounds and cuts from unsafe roads and from contracting   disease from contaminated soil, especially when walking is a primary   mode of transportation. And if you’ve ever seen signs that say “No   Shoes, No Service,” imagine if it read “No Shoes, No School.”  </p>
        <p class="content"><strong>Blake Mycoskie,</strong> founder of <strong> TOMS Shoes</strong>, decided that something needed to be done after a trip   to Argentina. TOMS Shoes’ premise is simple—for every pair of shoes   purchased, the company would match the pair and give it to a shoeless   child. TOMS organizes “Shoe Drop Tours,” where TOMS Supporters actually   travel to places like Argentina and Haiti, and hand deliver the shoes. </p>

        <p class="content">Since the company’s inception in   Venice, California, “TOMS has given over 140,000 pairs of shoes…and   plans to give over 300,000 pairs of shoes to children in need around   the world in 2009,” according to their web site—and there is only   more to come.<img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/TomsShoesBin.jpg" alt="tomsbin" width="177" height="211" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">TOMS has a variety of styles, colors,   designs, and even vegan options for consumers to choose from. They even   have boot styles, hats, t-shirts and options for babies.</p>

<p class="content"><span class="style4">I</span>n 2025, who knows what may become   of the world. We may be living in space like<em> The Jetsons</em>—walking   on the moon. By then we may have computer chips in our minds, so texting   is instantaneous, and we may just very well be able to save Africa. </p>
        <p class="content"><strong>Omni Peace</strong> was created in response   to seeing the devastation of poverty and disease in Sub-Saharan Africa,   in hopes that it could change the conditions by the year 2025. It all   started with a chocolate bar to raise money and a t-shirt, and grew   into something on a much larger scale. Joining forces with Sachs and   Millennium Promise, OmniPeace evolved into a full on brand<img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/omniopeacecreator.jpg" alt="mary" width="370" height="237" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />. </p>
        <p class="content"><strong>Mary Fanaro</strong>, founder of OmniPeace,   gets by with a little help from her friends. Enlisting support from   her celebrity friends, Courtney Cox, Jennifer Aniston, and Naomi Campbell,   Fanaro was able to simultaneously launch the brand on both the east   and the west coast. </p>
        <p class="content">The Los Angeles based company gives   25 percent of all of their profits to end extreme poverty and promote   human rights, education and peace in Africa. “OmniPeace was so successful   in its first year that it sold over $300,000 for Millennium Promise   and buildOn,” according to their web site.<img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/omnipeacegraffittishirt.jpg" alt="tshirt" width="221" height="218" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
