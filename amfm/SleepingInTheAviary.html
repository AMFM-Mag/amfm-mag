      <p class="style4">SLEEPING IN THE AVIARY Q&amp;A WITH NEW BAND MEMBER CELESTE HUELE        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="content">This month<strong> amfm</strong> spoke with the newest member, <strong>Celeste Huele</strong>, of the Midwest-based band, <strong>Sleeping in the Aviary</strong>. The band has made a complete 180 with the October release of their second album <strong><em>Expensive Vomit in a Cheap Hotel</em></strong>. The sound is more indie-folk driven, while the songs are longer and slower than the two minute, quick paced, Violent Femmes style found on their first album, <strong><em>Oh, This Old Thing?</em></strong> Sleeping in the Aviary has the ability to bring forth an array of sounds, and this album is a reflection of that. </p>
          <p class="content">The album is also a reflection of the different counts of tragedy the some members of the band were facing at the time, but Kozel described the songs as “hopeful” on their label, Science of Sound’s, web site. Huele joined other band members,<strong> Elliott Kozel (guitar/vocals), Michael Sienkowski (drums) and Phil Mahlstadt (bass</strong>), making the band a quartet. Huele brings the party, along with an accordion, musical saw, and back-up vocals, adding a different element to the group.    The band’s sound has definitely matured a lot in the two years in between albums. In that time, Kozel and Sienkowski both released solo projects. That, plus adding a new band member really gave the band chance to somewhat re-invent themselves.</p>

          <p class="content"><strong>Celeste Huele:</strong> I really enjoyed this 3'x3' stage we played on somewhere in New  Hampshire.  It sort of felt like those team building exercises you do at camp where it  sucks at the time, but  it's kind of funny and you feel like you are learning something.  And then afterwards you aren't totally sure what you learned and maybe it was all just  some sort of metaphor.</p>
          <p class="content"> <strong>amfm:</strong> Do you think that the Midwest is a good place for a band to make a name for themselves?       </p>
          <p class="content"><strong>CH:</strong> There are too many band names at this point, so it doesn't really matter where you  are. The good names seem to  be taken.</p>
          <p class="content"><strong>amfm:</strong> Your sophomore album came out in early October. Did you guys feel that sophomore album pressure?</p>
          <p class="content"> <strong>CH:</strong> We are all very relaxed people for the most part.   </p>
          <p class="content"><strong>amfm:</strong> Why do you think it’s important to evolve with each album?       </p>
          <p class="content"><strong>CH:</strong> I don't know how important it is to evolve with each album as  long as you are being  real with yourself and with how you feel like expressing yourself at any particular time.</p>
          <p class="content"> <strong>amfm:</strong> So, you're the new band member. What do you bring to the group?</p>
          <p class="content"> <strong>CH: </strong>Sometimes I bring snacks or beverages to the group, other times I bring fireworks,  glowsticks or other instant party starters.   </p>
          <p class="content"><strong>amfm:</strong> How does it feel to be the only girl in the band?<img src="images/Sleeping in the Aviary/bandpic.jpg" alt="bandpic" width="334" height="264" hspace="10" vspace="5" border="5" align="right" /></p>
          <p class="content"> <strong>CH:</strong> At times, I feel guilty being the only girl.  The guys really don't  know a thing about  cooking or sympathizing with others, and they're so stubborn with directions.  Usually  we just have a lot of fun and I find myself reading Cathy comics and trying to stay out of  everyone's way! </p>
          <p class="content"><strong>amfm:</strong> A lot of the 2nd album was written in tragedy, how does this shine through in the album?</p>
          <p class="content"> <strong>CH: </strong>I think it shines through in the all the references to death and  heroin and stuff.  </p>
          <p class="content"><strong>amfm:</strong> What does the title “Expensive Vomit in a Cheap Hotel” mean to you guys? How did you come up with it?</p>
          <p align="left" class="content"> <strong>CH:</strong> To me, it's sort of the same as when you wake up and look around the room and  realize that the night you just experienced  had prematurely aged and rotted before  you, and both the acidity and sweetness of your ideas and expectations rose too  exceedingly fast to ripen and be appreciated.  But it was a pretty  awesome night  regardless.</p>
          <p align="left" class="content"> <strong>amfm:</strong> Why is your website so creepy?</p>
          <p align="left" class="content"> <strong>CH: </strong>Hacked by Satan. </p>
          <p align="left" class="content"><strong>amfm:</strong> What’s next for the band?</p>
          <p align="left" class="content"> <strong>CH:</strong> We have all relocated to Minneapolis at this point and are excited to be able to  practice and work on songs together again! </p>
