      <p><strong>Klassik</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">If you&rsquo;ve followed Kellen Abston aka Klassik&rsquo;s music career in Milwaukee you will have heard the evolution of an artist, and those of you from Milwaukee have been able to witness it. His beats just keep getting more sophisticated, and that&rsquo;s even after his impressive first album Death of a Beatmaker.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">He has an amazing ability to use unconventional beats and samples like in &ldquo;Anything&rsquo;s&rdquo; Hall and Oats tip or &quot;Boogie's&quot; Michael Jackson sample. Sometimes he combines hard hip hop beats with jazz, piano or strings, like a hip-hop symphony. Some of his best shows have included two violinists in the set, and if you&rsquo;re lucky he&rsquo;ll whip out the saxophone.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">He&rsquo;s been a jazz and classical saxist since he was 11 years old, influenced by his late father who introduced him to the instrument. He had his first taste of stage stardom as a youngster when he played a solo for the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, and later toured Europe with his saxophone when he was 16. &nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Mentored at a young age by local jazz legend Berkeley Fudge, and his father, who was shot and killed in his home when he was 11, Klassik is making sure people know his name and is carrying the torch of his father&rsquo;s legacy through his music. He&rsquo;s already opened up for Talib Kweli at Summerfest, and Kendrick Lamar in Chicago, was named 88.9&rsquo;s award for Artist of the Year and won the award for the 2013 Wisconsin Area Music Industry (WAMI) Hip-Hop Artist of the Year. &nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Klassik knows he&rsquo;s destined for greatness. That&rsquo;s why he works so hard, and why he named his new album Young Rising Phenoms. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s destined to be a classic, and he&rsquo;ll settle for nothing less. Which is also why he dropped out of college to pour all of himself into his music career.</p>
      <p dir="ltr">He&rsquo;s so close he can taste it, but hip-hop, if you can even call it that lately, is dominated by the packaged 2 Chains, and Juicy J&rsquo;s of our day, at least mainstream hip-hop is. They are rising, but far from phenomenal, and Klassik is just that. There&rsquo;s a certain undertone of restlessness to this album, but not distress, despite  his past and the city that he resides in. </p>      Ray Nitti and CooCoo Cal are some of the only rappers from Milwaukee to make it mainstream, and Cal&rsquo;s song was called &ldquo;My Projects&rdquo; if that mirrors what kind of life young minorities are living in this city. Dreams like Klassik&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t made in Milwaukee for a lot of young black men. Milwaukee, the same place that incarcerates black men at higher rates than anywhere in the nation, and where dreams are deferred with the closing of a bar. <br />
      <p dir="ltr">Klassik is an anomaly to that notion, yet not devoid of it either. This past summer before a gig outside of G-Daddy&rsquo;s BBC he had a run in with the police, having done nothing to warrant any mistreatment, he was only trying to do the right thing, he was arrested and eventually let go. He later performed to a crowd chanting &ldquo;Free Klassik.&rdquo;</p>      Klassik makes feel good music. Like Kanye West says in &ldquo;So Appalled&rdquo; &ldquo;Niggas is going through real shit, man, they outta work, that&rsquo;s why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt.&rdquo; Klassik has them running to the floor. Milwaukee also has one of the highest unemployment rates of African-American men in the nation, and for a kid who dropped out of school a future can look bleak, but Klassik&rsquo;s future is bright. He raps about the constant hustle of chasing his dreams. It seems he&rsquo;s just waiting for his turn, and putting himself out there in the work, and it shows on each album, in every song. Each song is made as though it were his last, a chance to show them what he&rsquo;s made of, and prove the naysayers wrong.<strong><br />

      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>Why do you think of yourself as an old soul?      
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>I think of myself as an old soul because the place in my heart where all my inspiration comes from, the rhythms and the melodies, has an old-fashioned, authentic warmth to it. That&rsquo;s the part of my heart and soul that I draw upon to make sense of everything. &nbsp;My values and the way that I articulate them through music is an art seldom found in our present-day offerings.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm:</strong> How long have you been playing saxophone and how do you feel that it has influenced your music and yourself as a person?</p>
      <strong>klassik: </strong>I&rsquo;ve been playing saxophone for about 13 years, started back in 4th grade. I think I was extremely fortunate to have the sax be my first instrument in finding my musical voice, because it is one of the key illustrators of the jazz language, which is in turn, the backbone for most contemporary, and especially hip-hop/R&amp;B music. Since I not only acknowledge that influence, but actually grew through that musical heritage from jazz to hip-hop myself, my approach to creating and choice of sounds will always reflect that in a very genuine, candid fashion. &nbsp;It helped me to connect the dots, much as A Tribe Called Quest, Souls of Mischief, De La Soul, and a host of other innovative 90s&rsquo; hip-hop acts learned to, and built an entire new sound by borrowing from their musical predecessors. Passing the torch.
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>How many instruments do you play? (What are they?)</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik:</strong> I play sax, tenor and alto, and shortly thereafter I began teaching myself piano. Just this past year, I picked up an electric and acoustic guitar, so that&rsquo;s been my muse lately. &nbsp;So I believe the answer is three. &nbsp;Working on increasing that number!</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>How did you evolve from a jazz saxist to a hip hop artist and why did you feel the need to evolve?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>In middle school, I started making beats on Fruity Loops (say that with a straight face haha) on the side of my main jazz studies. &nbsp;After really starting to study some of my great producer influences, like The Neptunes, I started to see the application of jazz melodies and chords in popular music, specifically in hip-hop. &nbsp;My evolution just happened naturally, not so much intentionally. I think my constant desire to be a performer lead me more to writing my own songs and putting out my own music. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>Why is making music so important to you? why do you feel it is your calling?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>Music is important to me because I recognized it as a passion early on, and never let go of it. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s always been a constant in my life, amidst the ups and downs. &nbsp;Kind of hard to really explain, it&rsquo;s just something I&rsquo;ve always known. &nbsp;Some kids grow up wanting to be firefighters or lawyers, and then they grow to be something completely different after falling out of love with that dream, or being discouraged from it. I don&rsquo;t ever see myself falling out of love with this, and I&rsquo;ve gotten nothing but love and support for it. &nbsp;Making music brings the greatest joy to my life, and I think it brings joy to others, so that is what I think my calling is; not just to make music, but to make music that moves people&rsquo;s hearts and souls.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>Although you dropped out of school to focus on your music career, in reference to your song with B.Free, 9to5, if you did have to have a conventional profession what do you think that would be? what would be your most hated job?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik:</strong> I was going to school to be an English teacher, studying Secondary-English education at UW-Madison. &nbsp;I have this affinity for literary analysis, and just the art of language, and how beautiful that can be. &nbsp;That kind of helped me as a songwriter as well, I believe, so if I wasn&rsquo;t doing music, I think I&rsquo;d be an English teacher for high school kids. I always loved my English teachers and the tools of knowledge they provided me. My most hated job would probably be a cook, because I am currently a kitchen fail. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s one art I may never excel at, unfortunately. &nbsp;So for all the women out there looking for a guy who can throw down in the kitchen, I regret to inform you I am not your man haha. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>When did you come to the realization that music was much more than a hobby?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>That realization came from years of dedication to that hobby, which even initially started out as much more than just that. &nbsp;The moment I played &ldquo;Summertime&rdquo; with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra as a featured soloist in 6th grade, and felt that rush of playing in front of hundreds of people in the Performing Arts Center, I knew then that that&rsquo;s where I needed to always be. As I became more confident in my abilities over the years, I also became more confident in my purpose to create for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>What is the difference between a hobby and an obsession to you?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik:</strong> A hobby is something that you pick up here and there, something that you don&rsquo;t take too seriously. Being that my passion now could be considered a sort-of healthy obsession, I can say that the difference is the amount of time you dedicate to that craft. &nbsp;It literally consumes your every waking moment. Music is my obsession, my love, my passion, and my life. The obsession stems from the perfectionist attitude that I have. I want to dedicate my life to becoming one of the greats in music. &nbsp;Period.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>What do you think about today's music? What do you think it takes to be a classic artist?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>I think there are a lot of great things going on in the music world. There is always going to be a lot of non-musical trash, and there&rsquo;s just as much now as ever. &nbsp;The difference now is that the caliber of the emerging artists is escalating, and there are so many unique, refreshing artists who are putting passion back into their music. &nbsp;The detriment to our musical community, as has always been the case, is the artist who is only in it for material gain, with little to no interest to furthering and improving the craft. &nbsp;Those artists will never be classic artists. Classic artists are timeless artists, and timeless artists bring something fresh and new to listeners ears, and like I said earlier, their hearts and souls.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> how did you change as an artist between making Death of a Beatmaker and In The Making? What kind of place are you now a year after making what you call your &quot;baby&quot;?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>klassik:</strong> Death of a Beatmaker was my introduction, me finding my voice as a recording artist. &nbsp;I wrote that in between finishing up In The Making, as a way to give people a more immediate take on where I was, before I gave them my baby. That helped start the sound I was going for, and then I think &ldquo;In The Making&rdquo; was me really coming into my own and knocking that sound out of the park. I made every song with the mindset that I would perform it in stadiums. Lofty, I know, but that attitude was key in the big, epic, heavily orchestrated sound that came out. Now that I&rsquo;ve made that statement and have given the world the fruits of my labor, there is a relief and renewed confidence that came with the great critical and fan response I&rsquo;ve gotten this past year. With this project I&rsquo;m getting ready to put out , YRP (Young Rising Phenoms), people will hear that some of that euphoria of success has worn off, and so now I&rsquo;m even more passionate and hungrier than ever for that recognition and appreciation. Yeah, I&rsquo;ve won some awards, and received great accolades, but I&rsquo;ve also performed on big stages with my name spelled wrong, and still fighting with local venues to get opportunities to put on larger productions. Fighting the fight of the passionate local artist who has dreams of hitting international stages, but can&rsquo;t seem to get enough love at home; that&rsquo;s what YRP sounds like. There are darker moments, a certain bite and aggression that was not as prevalent on In The Making. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s where I am as an artist, like, &ldquo;Hey, I wanna do really great things for this city and for the musical world, believe in me! &nbsp;We can do so much, but it has to be collectively, as a united city and scene, so that we can compete on any stage.&rdquo;</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>What has beeyour most memorable live performance? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik:</strong> Summerfest had the title until my last show. &nbsp;Summerfest was my biggest stage, and my biggest crowd as &ldquo;Klassik,&rdquo; but my last show here in Milwaukee speaks so much more to where my heart and passion lies. While standing up to some unjust police harassment outside of the show, I was consequently arrested, driven downtown, and fed all kinds of BS from a couple of power-hungry, authority-abusing officers. &nbsp;I was supposed to shoot a video during the show, but ended up being gone long enough to have my director leave. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know if I was coming back. &nbsp;By the grace of the oh-so-courteous police officers, I made it back just in time to do my set and close out the night&rsquo;s festivities. &nbsp;I had so much rage and frustration from the altercation that, after breaking a bathroom window, I went on stage and left it all up there. &nbsp;I feel like I just blacked out on the mic, my spirit just took over. &nbsp;Because of that rage being able to be channeled through my craft, I think I gave my most memorable performance to date. &nbsp;Ironically, it was to a crowd of about 25. &nbsp;I got on stage and everyone was chanting &ldquo;Free Klassik!&rdquo; &nbsp;It was pretty awesome.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>If you had a musician whose philosophy you agreed with the most would it be and why? </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>More irony: I&rsquo;m listening to that artist now as I&rsquo;m answering this, and that artist is Bob Marley. I watched the &ldquo;Marley&rdquo; documentary some months ago, and I think that his continuous message of love and positivity is something that I would like to bring with my own music. Watching that documentary really instilled new life and purpose to my passion. You could see the spirit of the music take him over on stage, like his soul was singing. I want to bring that love and positive vibes back to the masses, especially in these crazy times. With Marley, you got the feeling that music could really change the world, and I still believe that. &nbsp;</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>What is the biggest takeaway you got from your musical mentor Berkley Fudge?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>Berkley Fudge helped me find my musical voice, and trust the feeling of the music more so than just the technical aspect of performing. &nbsp;To this day, I believe I&rsquo;ve found success because the most important part of creating music for me is the mood that is evoked. I create based on feeling, which in turn reproduces those feelings for the listener. With that philosophy, I think in the long run, I will forever be indebted to him. Sure he showed me key jazz runs and improvisational licks, and started my foundation of musical theory, especially jazz theory, but most importantly he showed me how to use that knowledge to best convey the true feeling of the melodies I created.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>Describe inner me/enemy. Do you believe this to be true about yourself? How do you fight yourself?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>That was the darkest side of In The Making. That song was me realizing that my biggest obstacle to success is always going to be myself, because like most passionate artists, as I said before, I&rsquo;m a perfectionist and demand a lot of myself. &nbsp;I constantly find ways to challenge myself, and they&rsquo;re not always pleasant challenges. Sometimes I&rsquo;m fighting too much, and have to take a step back from myself. &nbsp;Sometimes I find myself smoking too many cigarettes or drinking too many scotches on the rocks, trying to escape the pressure that I unfortunately place on myself. The cliche gift and the curse. The same passion that drives me to create memorable works and performances is the same passion that sometimes causes doubt and despair. I&rsquo;m learning to balance that, you know, not be so hard on myself, but the most important thing is that I&rsquo;m still here, and even in the darkest of my days, I&rsquo;m able to pull a little light out with my music. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>Why is your father your biggest influence? What legacy did he leave behind to you?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>My father is my biggest influence because I was blessed with a bright, creative spirit who instilled his love for the arts in me, just by living his life. I saw the joy that acting and singing and dancing brought to him, and I admired that early on. With his untimely passing, and me being at the impressionable young age of 11, I found new purpose in continuing that artistic legacy. Everything I do with this music career, every success I enjoy, I imagine that my father is able to posthumously, vicariously live through me. A big part of me believes that it is his intelligent artistic passions that direct me, along with other higher powers. &nbsp;I owe it to him to do everything he never got the chance to do; see the world and bring the love for the arts he gave me to the entire world, so that I never stop making him proud.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>How has milwaukee helped mold you as an artist?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik: </strong>Milwaukee introduced me to Berkley Fudge. I found jazz here. I studied music in our great public schools, public ART schools at that! That just doesn&rsquo;t really exist anymore and many other places. I was able to nurture my craft while getting a quality education. That alone I think is the greatest contribution to me as an artist from the city. That and just the host of other talented artists and just great human beings that I&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to come across and befriend. That&rsquo;s why I get so passionate about having people come out and support, and help elevate our diverse artistic and cultural scene to the international level. I owe it to the city, to these great people, but not everyone sees it that way.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">amfm: </strong>What&rsquo;s next in the making for Klassik?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-55dda594-3d9f-bb83-d8f8-f14ca7ec7582">klassik:</strong> I like what you did there haha. YRP is next, and that is, like i said, the next level of dedication and hunger for Klassik, the artist. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also just a stepping stone to my next big production, which is a soundtrack and corresponding semi-autobiographical film entitled &ldquo;Time Of Our Lives.&rdquo; &nbsp;My good friends and collaborators Xavier Ruffin (director), Karl &ldquo;Oye&rdquo; Iglesias and I are in the beginning stages of the screenplay and other logistics for that. &nbsp;Think &ldquo;Purple Rain&rdquo; (probably my favorite movie!), meets &ldquo;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the angle we&rsquo;re going for. &nbsp;I just plan to continue to elevate my artistic platform, and enrich the culture. And as always, show the world how to keep it Klassik. Like what I did there? &nbsp;Haha. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to continue to use my talents to improve the world we live; ultimately that&rsquo;s all I want. <br />
