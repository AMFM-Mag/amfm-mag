      <p>Bryan Jones and Hugh Cleal of Golf Clap came together way back one New Year's Eve night, and the years since then have been nothing but golden for this DJ duo hailing from Detroit. They have played all over the country, taking their entertaining peak hour deep house sets to the masses showing them what Detroit has to offer. They were voted Best Electronic Artist in Detroit by readers of <em>Real Detroit Weekly</em> this year. </p>
      <p>This was their first time playing Detroit Movement this year at the Made In Detroit Stage. They recently just launched their own label Country Club Disco to further promote their music and their mission and their love for music to anyone who will hear and enjoy a good time.      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">amfm: </strong>So this is your first time playing Movement? </p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">Golf Clap: </strong>Yep our first time! I  played in the merch booth like ten years ago, I really did! Back then they allowed you to you set up a DA system in the merch booth. (Bryan)<br />
      </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">amfm: </strong>How do you feel that your first performance went and how did you like the crowd? What do you think of the festival in general?</p>
<strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">Golf Clap: </strong>It was earlier in the day, so I was wondering compared to yesterday I wondered how many people were going to show up. Gabi played right before us, and she&rsquo;s one of our friends we play with alot so it was cool that we were playing back to back where a lot of the same friends came to meet up. When we went on stage it was super gratifying to see everybody from all the different states and all our friends show up, it was super cool. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">amfm: </strong>You guys played the Made in Detroit stage, how have you seen the Detroit electronic music scene evolve since your involvement?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">Gold Clap: </strong>We kind of did the do-it-yourself method, and if we weren&rsquo;t playing every show we wanted to play, we threw our own, and play what we want to play. The more and more that we have success stories about events, the more people trust us to do what we feel is the thing to do. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">amfm: </strong>How did you guys link up and start DJing together?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">Gold Clap: </strong>Originally, on my old label Coyote Cuts, we made a single and eventually did a mix compilation then that led to us talking a lot online and I invited him up for gig on New Year's Eve. It was random too, because it was like the night of the party and I asked him what he was doing tonight, and told him to get in the car, I will change all the time slots and we can pretty much headline it and hang out. He started coming up every other week, and then he just stayed, and I was like you should just move in here because there&rsquo;s a lot of shows up here and the scene is really big. He&rsquo;s been living with me every since, and we&rsquo;ve been working and producing full time together. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">amfm: </strong>You guys also just started your own record label, how&rsquo;s that been going? Why did you want to do that?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">Golf Clap: </strong>The label is Country Club disco. Basically we have to shop track to other labels and decide whether they like it and want to promote it the way that we want them to, where when it&rsquo;s our own thing, we can go all out, spend a bunch of extra money on promotion if we want, basically do what we want. We&rsquo;d rather just have control of it and own our own music too if possible. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">amfm: </strong>What do you guys love about Detroit?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-c29770a1-5a59-d5cd-d6b3-ca717747ad65">Gold Clap: </strong>I grew up in Detroit, Bryan grew up in Indiana and Chicago playing gigs and stuff like that. Even with all the travels that we&rsquo;ve done, the main thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that Detroit is a scene with a very discerning crowd that knows what they want, they know about good music,but in the same token there&rsquo;s micro scenes of people where any given night there&rsquo;s going to be five or six dope parties going on. I don&rsquo;t go to that many cities where there&rsquo;s that much going on. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of different opportunities to move to a lot of cities, but the fact of the matter is that Detroit has one of the best music scenes in the entire country, maybe even the world. </p>
