      <p><strong>Phox</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Phox may be from a small town in Wisconsin, but they are making big waves in music. They just released their self-titled debut album after the success and accolades of their EP &ldquo;Confetti&rdquo; was released in 2013. This six piece band began with a group of childhood friends who enjoyed making music together, and evolved to the next level when they added the indie songstress Monica Martin to the mix. </p>
      Martin is enchanting, as are most lead women of female fronted bands. Her dreamy lyrics layered over the guitar, bass, keys, flute and sometimes whistles of Phox add a lilting element to the flowery, fun, folky sounds of their music. With others picking up on that, the band has been in a whirlwind contrary to their debut hit song &ldquo;Slow Motion.&rsquo;&rsquo; <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">amfm: </strong>You guys all grew up together in Baraboo, Wisconsin, kinda went off did your separate things, and got back together to form the band. Do you remember what that moment was like deciding to and then making music together for the first time?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">phox:</strong> Absolutely. We were all coming from different paths and varying levels of experience with music and being in a band. At that point, it was just the boys and we mostly tried making experimental rock music which was pretty fun, and it was how we first became creative as a group. It didn't really go anywhere though, and we lacked a singer and someone with song ideas. We were just a bad basement jam band. We decided to somehow trick Monica into being our singer. We knew she had an immense, though completely hidden, talent to sing, and she had discussed with Matt about testing the waters with songwriting. We wanted to support her and see if we couldn't make a whole that was greater than the sum of all our parts. It was rough for a while, but I think sometimes iron sharpens iron. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">amfm:</strong> You've been getting a lot of positive buzz since your 2013 EP released and have been making a name for yourself nationally and internationally playing the iTunes Festival in London. How does this feel being a band based in a small town in Wisconsin that Monica once said she didn't expect to last longer than a month? How have people back home been responding?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">phox:</strong> I think we are all still trying to wrap our heads around the last year or two. It's been a really wild ride that none of us could have ever expected. Every once in a while we'll have a collective &quot;oh, wow!&quot; kind of moment because it's hard to believe that we are getting to meet incredible people while traveling the world, all because of what began as a gang of aimless friends trying to become better people (and sometimes playing music was a part of that). We are lucky that Madison has shown us so much love and has supported us so readily since we first started playing for 15 people in coffee shops and the like. Baraboo is removed just enough that for the most part we can go undetected. But of course, being a small town, there are a lot of good folks that do know us and will always be sure to treat you to a coffee and a catching-up. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">amfm: </strong>You are releasing your first self-titled full length album this summer, What were some inspirations behind the songs? How would you describe it?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">phox: </strong>The album is almost a memoir in a few ways. Monica's writing is often a reflection of real events and emotions in her life. It's a process that can be very personal and maybe even uncomfortable at times, but I think it also comes across as genuine and relatable. This album is also a collection of songs that are familiar to our fingers, as well as brand new ones, and I like to think that the album is to some degree a memoir and celebration of the past few years of our lives together. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">amfm: </strong>You'll also be heading on tour, what do you love about touring and what are you most looking forward to? (Do you guys drive? Who's the best driver?) </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">phox: </strong>One of the most wonderful things about tour is that we get to stay in touch and see old friends that we otherwise would almost never get to. I think at least a few of us cannot wait to get to the west coast. I'm in love with the Bay Area and LA and of course all of the sun! Luckily, for once, being a bigger band makes driving easier. We, for the most part, take turns rotating into pilot and copilot, but Matt loves gettin' down in the city, and the Roberts boys venture the twilight drives. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">amfm: </strong>What do you guys do in your down time?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-6d688a8a-cbc4-7120-2b5c-1bdfea7496b8">phox: </strong>Well, unfortunately we haven't had much of that this year. Our only time off we had to use to move out of our house! Nevertheless, when we do have down time, you can pretty much count on us poking around at coffee joints, catching the new episode of Game of Thrones, kickin' it in our kitchen with a brew in hand, or working on a new video. Pretty normal, Wisconsinite, 20-something's stuff. <br />
