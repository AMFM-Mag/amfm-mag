      <p dir="ltr">There is something awe struck about the work of Korean artist, Heeseop Yoon, and it isn&rsquo;t just the fact that she uses black masking tape as her medium to make lines in her artwork. Her work fills the vast spaces of gallery walls across the globe with such intricacy unlike anything many people have seen before. Spilling over onto the ceiling, the floor, and doorways and everything inbetween, her work is bursting at the seams. </p>      She explores the hidden clutter of our lives and exposes them for all to see. Inspired by &ldquo;stuff,&rdquo; Yoon challenges her own perception and memory of time and space through things found, left behind and acquired in the junk drawers of our lives. Seemingly &ldquo;still-lifes&rdquo; these pieces hold so much vitality in the objects portrayed. A keyboard, a hunk of cords, a car, a paint can, are just a few items you can make out in these large amalgamations seen through the eyes of Yoon. <strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">&nbsp;</strong> <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">amfm: </strong>How did you get started working with the black masking tape? Was it an experimental process to begin with that evolved into your practice, or something you set out to explore? How is it working with the tape, and the process behind it?</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">heeseop yoon: </strong>My entire body of work started with the idea of making drawings with materials that are challenging to draw with. My earlier art education in Korea was very much focused on learning draftsmanship through repetitive practice, and at a certain point the act of drawing became very tedious. It had gotten to the point that making a line with traditional drawing materials was almost an unconscious action. Drawing a line was so fast and easy that I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about the process of making a mark. I wanted to find a way to slow the process of seeing and then drawing. Using non-traditional materials, such as a knife or masking tape, limits some of the freedom and slows the process of mark-making. I used to make Myar cutout drawings that look like the visual inverse of my recent tape drawings. I think of my Mylar cutouts as a knife-drawing series. Drawing with a knife requires full attention because the mark is so definite. I liked how the three-dimensional or x-ray-esque illusion created by the translucent layers of white Mylar drew attention to the formal layers of the drawn objects. But at the same time, those pieces felt more focused on the objects that were drawn than on the act of drawing them. I wanted to find a way to work within the traditional constraints of drawing, black lines on a white background, while making drawings that are about the experience of line rather than the representation of objects. Masking tape became my material of choice - it is still challenging to draw with, but a much faster, more direct way to make a mark than a knife.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">amfm: </strong>Your pieces examine the culture of modern debris, hoarding and collecting of things that inevitably get left behind, dust over or forgotten about. Why the interest in cluttered spaces? How did you come to begin to explore this and want to make a commentary about it? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">yoon: </strong>At the beginning, it started as more of a formal interest. I was attracted to these massive piles of things, and the anonymous, decontextualized quality they had. I wanted to make still life drawings that were about perception and mark-making rather than the narrative of the objects themselves. The more I worked with claustrophobic spaces, I started to realize that these are the spaces hidden within our lives. We have so many things that we forget about. We struggle for space for ourselves and for the things we own. Now I am interested in these as lost spaces.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">amfm: </strong>You work with the mistakes in your work and they almost become a part of the pieces themselves and a way for you to explore perception. What role do you think &quot;mistakes&quot; hold in your art and in art as a whole? When can mistakes be good? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">yoon:</strong> As mentioned earlier, my art education was very much focused on achieving a formal perfection, and there were very little room for mistakes. Now I feel like my work is all about making mistakes. I don&rsquo;t consider these &lsquo;mistakes&rsquo; as mistakes we think, they are just the way I see certain things at certain moment. There are no marks that are not correct or need to be erased in my drawings. When I work, I don&rsquo;t make sketches or project images to make the drawings. Once I put lines on the surface, I don&rsquo;t erase or remove them. If I want to change the        drawing I just add more lines on top of the existing ones. These &lsquo;mistakes&rsquo; that I make in the process of my drawing appear as double or multiples lines as I apply &lsquo;corrections&rsquo;. They reflect the accumulation of time, and how my perception has changed and become less clear over time. <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">amfm: </strong>With your work being installation based because of your tape medium it adds this layer of impermanence and also debris in a certain sense. Do you feel any attachment to your work, working such a large scale and devoting so much time to it only to deconstruct it in the end? You said you try to recycle the older pieces, why? Does that add to the concept of your work?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">yoon: </strong>Before I start making drawings installations on Mylar, I used to make drawings with tape directly on the wall. At that time, the entire drawings had to be literally destroyed at the end of the show. I enjoyed making something very big and time consuming that are so ephemeral, but after awhile I felt like I was getting attached to my drawings, and I was also getting tired of not saving any work after devoting so much time and energy. Now most of my installations are more like site-adaptable than site-specific, meaning that same piece can travel to different spaces. Although that specific shape of the drawing installation can exit only in that particular space, the drawing itself can be saved and re-installed at different spaces. As one drawing moves from one place to other spaces, it can be expanded with new elements or could shrunk with less drawing parts. The drawing is made from the photographs of chaotic objects in the junk stores, storage spaces and factories from different places such as Korea, Germany and United States. The installation in some ways resembles room scale architectural sketches, imposing the abstracted forms of remembered spaces upon a location. By framing the exhibition spaces with remixed memories of other spaces, the piece offers the questions regarding the passage of time and the nature of place.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">amfm: </strong>With your work dealing so much with clutter, things and objects, I would imagine that you live a very minimalist life. Is that true or do you have a lot of things too? Are you conscious about that? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-8f1fb835-cc19-cc47-06d3-f7b8a3e69eae">yoon: </strong>I grew up with three siblings, and there was always competition between us for things. It was a constant battle to get what I wanted, and once I got it I never threw it away. Now, I own very few, mostly practical things, and I keep them for long periods of time.</p>
