      <p><strong>Little Animal</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">With roots in techno and the birth of Motown, music is in Detroit&rsquo;s bones. The same goes for Rachelle and Nick of Little Animal, a new duo, combining those roots and making it their own with a hint of electronic, indie and R&amp;B. Front woman Rachelle is meek and charming, yet feisty and big when it comes to her vocals and stage presence, hence the name Little Animal. Nick is the mastermind behind the beats and production.<br />
        <br />
      The two of them were making music on their own, sharing beats and lyrics with one another and eventually decided to pair up musically - they also happen to be a couple. Combined they create an ethereal, quirky kind of sound energy together, full of galaxies, entropy and cats.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: </strong>How did the two of you link up and start making music together? Were you guys friends first? What is your dynamic like together?<br />
        <br />
        <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">nick: </strong>We started dating when we were freshman in college. We had a mutual love for music and making music. All throughout college in our spare time, we both were developing our production skills separately. Finally, in early 2013, we decided we were just about good enough to start putting things together. &quot;The Cycle&quot; was actually the first song we did together!<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>Our dynamic can be a little... difficult sometimes. We're both extremely detail-oriented (aka. perfectionists), so something that I think sounds great and ready to record over might be the furthest thing from done in Nick's ears, and the same goes for lyrics and vocals. I think it kind of pushes us to get things right and not just settle for something just because some instruments kind of sound okay together. Nick is pretty much the brains of the operation, I kind of provide excitement. And also charisma.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: </strong>What is the Detroit music scene like? How have you been influenced by it and embraced by it?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">nick: </strong>In Detroit, there are a lot of Rock acts and lot of Hip-Hop acts, so a lot of time, we get caught in the crossfire when we play shows. Everyone is very welcoming and friendly regardless.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>The Detroit music scene is kind of compiled of very close knit groups in different genres, but everyone is very cool! It's built on Rock, Hip Hop, and Techno, and since we borrow elements from all three, it's easy to feel a little left out. There are a few other groups that bend genres and are in this weird middle area of musical ambiguity, but the cool thing is the scene is very diverse. There's a little something for everyone!</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: </strong>Why the name Little Animal? What does it mean? Are you guys cat people?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">nick: </strong>I used to call Rachelle &quot;Little Animal&quot; because when we first met, I thought her mannerisms were very cute and animal-like. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>Basically, making fun of me.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">nick: </strong>Rachelle started using it when making and performing her own music. Since we're kind of bad at naming things, once we started making music together, we started using it. It was the most genuine and fit with the sound we were going for.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle:</strong> Yes, we are cat people!! We love cats and may or may not be cats!! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: </strong>You guys are a relatively new group, how has reception been and what have you learned or taken away as musicians in your short time on the scene? What was your first show like?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>Reception has been overall pretty great! I'm always a tiny bit surprised when older folks like us though. The one thing I've learned is that people want really hype and dancey songs, so we're working harder to try and incorporate more upbeat songs into our sets. Our first show was actually the fundraiser for Allied Media Conference, and I met some of my absolute favorite music folks there! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: </strong>Where does the inspiration for your songs come from? Who writes the music? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>I write the lyrics! When I first started writing, I was mostly writing about the feeling of living people kind of haunting you and haunting your thoughts. I tend to be very emotional when it comes to writing and a lot of times, I write about very personal things, but I always try to write in a way that I know other people could be feeling. I'm mostly inspired by dreams, comics, and the people around me. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">nick: </strong>My inspirations are always moments that I feel strongly about. I strive to create things that are strong, that make me feel heavy, and sometimes, even sad or melancholy. I never want to just make party music, I want to make things that make me feel a certain way, drawing upon the past to make me feel rooted in the future.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: &nbsp;</strong>How would you describe your music in three words? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>Thoughtful. Emotional. Sultry.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">nick: </strong>Truth. Love. Authenticity.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">amfm: </strong>What's next for your guys? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-a35b4390-cb8a-50a3-6c5e-ffed4bd203fe">rachelle: </strong>We're looking to hit the road sometime soon!! Get a taste of what music is like in other places and learn more about other cities' creative culture. And also working on releasing some new music. And videos with cats in them!</p>
