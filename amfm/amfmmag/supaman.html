      <p><strong>Supaman</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Hip-Hop artist Supaman is a prime example that you don&rsquo;t have to compromise who you are in order to make meaningful music for the masses. Supaman on the mic, and Christian Parrish Takes the Gun in his everyday life, he was born and raised on an Indian reservation in Montana, and has used his Native heritage as the backbone of his music. Sometimes when he raps he is known to don a full headdress and traditional garb. He also plays the hand drum, a wooden flute, and pow wow sings and dances, as he is a skilled traditional Crow dancer. </p>
      His flow is old school as he has been making music for over a decade. Upon first listen, it&rsquo;s hard to pick up that Supaman is rapping about faith over his hard hitting beats and intricate melodies. Having lived a less than charmed life with alcoholic parents, and after coming down on hard times in his life, he made a change for the greater good. This isn&rsquo;t your average religious music, this is simply the light shining through a talented Native spitting his truth through hip-hop. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">amfm: </strong>What about living and growing up on the reservation inspired you to make music? Were you surrounded by a musical influence growing up? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">supaman:</strong> Music is deep rooted in every culture and as Apsaalooke people we have our songs and our own music, so being &quot;musical&quot; is in the blood. What inspired me to make music was the outlet it gave me and the support of the creativity I was making. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">amfm:</strong> What drew you to hip hop music? The way you viewed hip-hop changed over time. You said you went from embracing some of the more negative stereotypes of rap in the beginning of your career, and shifted towards the positive and conscious aspect of hip hop, what caused that change?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">supaman:</strong> What drew me to hip hop music was the feeling it gave me. It felt good to hear those certain beats and rhythms. I was really influenced in a negative way by the music and gangster rap culture, I guess you could say, and it was doing nothing for me. It was leading me down a path of destruction. The change came to myself as a person first, and it just naturally became evident in the music I wanted to make for the listener. I realized that as artists we have a responsibility and we're all leaders whether we choose it or not. We are influencing our listeners in a negative or positive way. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">amfm: </strong>You were away from the Crow Nation reservation for some time and returned after hitting some hard times, were you trying to return to your roots and get grounded? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">supaman: </strong>No it was totally out of my control as a kid to where life was going. Alcoholism and choices my parents were making at the time. The Apsaalooke Nation is my home and where my heart is no matter where I go in life. I was raised on the Apsaalooke reservation and that is where my roots continue to be, and I take that with me wherever I go. A lot of people who are Native who don't live on the &quot;rez&quot; feel like they are a little out of touch with who they are and sometimes need to go back to where their people are to reconnect, sort of speak. I myself don't feel this way. I remain close to my family and I know the people and the people know me on my reservation, it's just normal life. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">amfm: </strong>Why did you did you want to infuse traditional Apsaalooke music, your dancing, and hip-hop together? What is something you want people to know about Native culture?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">supaman:</strong> I wanted to put them together because I have always kept them separate for years. I found that when I put the two worlds and cultures together, it became a powerful tool in reaching out and influencing people in a good way. I feel I&rsquo;m mature enough to step out in that way and know that it's not a gimmick, but a beautiful representation of who I am as a human being, and I'm comfortable doing that. I want people to know that Native culture is a beautiful, thriving, and a positive way of life that should be shared and celebrated throughout the world! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">amfm: </strong>What is the significance of your name Supaman? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-7b471e57-cbd1-c6ab-3667-1d60a4d08b2f">supaman: </strong>I was heading to a DJ battle and didn't have a name. So me and my partner were just brainstorming on a name and he said, &ldquo;You need something that represents good, but still takes out his enemies with ease.&rdquo; Supaman was fitting and off the wall also. I knew people would be like &quot;who's this guy calling himself Supaman?&quot; and would check it out just cause. Hopefully the multi talents displayed would do the name some justice! <br />
