      <p><strong>Bliss and Alice</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Bliss and Alice snuck into our ears and made quite a bang with his first mixtape Poetry Volume One. If you don&rsquo;t know who this Milwaukee emcee is, you should, because you are missing out on one of the rising stars of hip hop. His effort is masterful, coming from a rookie, who is spitting veteran lyrics over violins and horns, taking influences from jazz, classical, and electronic beats produced by <br />
      Ta-Ku. </p>      
      First and foremost a writer, his bars and cadence are like liquid poetry, or &ldquo;lyrical fucking warfare&rdquo; as he puts it in the introduction of his mixtape. If music is war, Bliss is killing it like a silent sniper. He lays out his life story, the good the bad and the ugly, does a little shit talking, and leaves you longing for Volume Two. When&rsquo;s that coming out again? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>You have a way with words, your album is straight up poetry lyrically. Did you grow up writing poetry? What about poetry speaks to you and how does this translate through to your music?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss and alice: </strong>Thanks. I&rsquo;ve been writing pretty consistently over one thought or another as long as I can remember. Albeit void of prominent or conventional poetic forms, most of my work lends to an overarching narrative…I could talk for hours trying to narrow down a fitting comment on how poetry speaks to me, some could make a rather convincing argument that I do ramble over it. So in short, I think of life as a sort of applied poetry, rap is a vehicle for spreading ideas by forcing cognition… <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>How did you get into making music? Did you always have the intent of being a rapper? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss: </strong>Gradually. I grew up around musicians and artists, so a lot of formative years were spent searching for shit I related to. It&rsquo;s a lot of garbage music you&rsquo;re exposed to in a smaller city between the gems, my sphere of influence is pretty disconnected…I wouldn&rsquo;t say it was intentional as much as it was natural. I was always writing and listening to music, so when my listening started to expand, so did the themes in my writing. Rap works for me, I have a lot of shit to say…For the perspective. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>What story are you trying to tell? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss:</strong> A universal one. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>This mixtape is so layered. The musical influence coming from jazz, classical and returning to that essence of good music that isn't like trap or all about turning up. Was it natural for you to fuse these styles together? You said you wouldn't put anything out unless you were in love with it, what was that process like putting together Poetry Volume One? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss: </strong>My music reflects my personality in a lot of ways, or so I&rsquo;m told. I think it&rsquo;s hard to say what&rsquo;s natural for my sound at this point, this is my first project. I think it&rsquo;s natural in the sense that I enjoy the sound and I haven&rsquo;t had anyone telling me what I should and shouldn&rsquo;t try. My process is very personal, I map things out how I want them to sound, then I&rsquo;m in the studio. Outside of building hoodlum from the ground up I think we had four sessions, it really didn&rsquo;t take very long to put it together. I knew what I wanted &nbsp;beforehand and we made it happen. It&rsquo;s not really a lot of discussion when we&rsquo;re in the studio over what anyone else thinks, unless I ask for that input and it&rsquo;s not a bunch of people around. I&rsquo;m focused. <br />
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>Can you talk a bit about growing up? A lot of your songs seem to be influenced by what sounds like a troubling and trying childhood, alluded to in the song Mademoiselle and Madness, and talks of drugs, and suicide. How does all of this influence your music and increase your drive? Why lay it all out?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss: </strong>I&rsquo;d rather not honestly. In a way music is a cathartic because I don&rsquo;t have to address anything personal by laying it out so that you &quot;understand me as a person.&quot; I don&rsquo;t really buy into that. My personal story has a lot to do with the music, but the music has a lot more to do with the listener than it does me. I went through a lot of crazy shit growing up, definitely, but it&rsquo;s not really about that, my story is more layered than a mixtape. Watch me grow as an artist and you&rsquo;ll catch where I&rsquo;m coming from… <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>It was a journey for you making music. Literally and figuratively. You took some time and went on a solo road trip and came back and delved into your music. What about that trip inspired you? What were some memorable moments and why did you need to take that trip?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss:</strong> I needed time away from everything and everyone. I was going through a lot of shit at the time and eventually I just said fuck it. I wasn&rsquo;t learning anything in school, my relationships were falling apart, I was really lost. I wanted to write and see things, draw inspiration from art I&rsquo;d never seen, and places I&rsquo;d never been. I think that trip taught me a lot about the difference between feeling lonely versus being alone. I learned how to be stuck in my head more efficiently...it&rsquo;s super hard to say. I met a lot of inspiring people, skated a lot of famous cities and parks I&rsquo;d only seen watching skate videos. I remember skating through Barcelona one day listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt8EEprXK1g">Channel Orange</a> on repeat, I skated for like eight hours touring the city and managed to write a few great verses. A lot of days like that were memorable, it&rsquo;s sort of hard to pinpoint anything. My most vivid memories are of days when I wrote a song I loved. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>What is the significance of your name Bliss and Alice? Who is Alice? What brings you bliss?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss:</strong> I can&rsquo;t comment on this at the moment. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm:</strong> Okay, do you think shit talking is healthy in rapping? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">bliss: </strong>Definitely. I think people are so afraid to speak on anything even remotely &ldquo;offensive&quot; for fear of critique these days, that&rsquo;s all bullshit to me. It&rsquo;s pointed remarks in everyone&rsquo;s head, talk your shit and do it exactly how you want to. I&rsquo;d rather listen to someone speak their mind than censor themselves for the recognition. Fuck that. People talk shit through music in all types of ways, it&rsquo;s supposed to be competitive. It&rsquo;s done in different ways, but instrumentalists talk shit with their instruments too…Art wouldn&rsquo;t exist how it does today if people weren&rsquo;t saying &ldquo;fuck that I can do that better&rdquo; in their heads. Rap just happens to be direct about it, as it should be. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-82185f68-cba5-9856-2d90-10efb6c043b3">amfm: </strong>What's next for you? Will there be a Poetry Volume two in the future?</p>
      <p><strong>bliss:</strong> Let&rsquo;s just say you&rsquo;ll be hearing and seeing a lot more from me. Poetry Volume Two is coming, when I won&rsquo;t say just yet.</p>
