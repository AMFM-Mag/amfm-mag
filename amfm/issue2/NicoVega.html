      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4">L</span>os Angeles band, <span class="style4">Nico Vega</span>, is so ready to explode. Since their forming in 2005, a fire’s been brewing. The spark was their constant touring, opening for acts like Gavin Rossdale, Shiny Toy Guns and Semi-Precious weapons in 2009. Their appearance on<em> Last Call with Carson Daly</em> that year officially made them a band to remember. <img src="../images/issue 2/nicovega/nicovega2.jpg" alt="nico vega" width="549" height="348" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p>One year later, the band has a full blown album, the self titled, <em>Nico Vega</em>. They’re doing festival performances, and got the awesome opportunity to tour with Canadian indie band, Metric for a couple shows. The band has been gaining more momentum and more fans at their shows ready to experience the Nico Vega legacy. </p>
        <p>You can tell guitarist, Rich Koehler, drummer, Dan Epand and vocalist, Aja Volkman love making music. Nico Vega’s energy takes over the stage. Frontwoman, Volkman, is unstoppable. She has a way of connecting with the music and the crowd while she’s on stage performing. amfm got the chance to do a Q&amp;A with Volkman, to talk about Nico Vega, touring, and the evolution of self.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>You guys are named after Mike Pena’s mother; however, Mike is no longer in the band, how did you make Nico Vega your own?</p>
        <p><strong>NICO VEGA’S AJA VOLKMAN:</strong> Nico Vega had a legacy. Her story made a huge impact on my life personally. It's been an amazing reminder for me to follow my own path, and do what I know is right for my own spirit. She was the victim of an over prescribed medication, and wasn't able to curb her use of pills before she passed away.</p>
        <p> I used to take a number of medications for disorders that I once believed in. I have qualities that have been previously mistaken as character defects. I always had trouble in school. I was always a perfectionist, and I had a low self esteem, which I still battle from time to time. But Nico Vega has taught me to respect myself, and be patient with my differences. They are the very things that have brought me success. They were only weaknesses when measured next to my peers. Therefore, the name carries a lot of meaning for me.  </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Nico Vega is described so virtuously, how to you try to embody that with your music?</p>
        <p><strong>NV: </strong>The idea of being no more or less than human is all that a modern day saint can be. It is powerful to be plagued with all of the perfect imperfections that create us all equal as humans. All we can do is live by trial and error, and be exactly who we are.  <strong><img src="../images/issue 2/nicovega/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="180" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></strong></p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How was it touring with Metric for a few shows? What was the most memorable moment, and did you learn anything from them?</p>
<p><strong>NV: </strong>It was amazing. I personally think that Emily is one of the best lyricists in the field. She inspires me a lot, and they have earned every ounce of success that they have gotten. I love that band. Every night was amazing on that tour. <img src="../images/issue 2/nicovega/aja.jpg" alt="aja" width="335" height="446" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> You guys have had the chance to perform at a couple of festivals,  what kinds of shows do you guys prefer doing?</p>
        <p><strong>NV:</strong> I love every show for it's own unique energy. Some prove to be tougher than others, but we grow none the less.  </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Aja, you have such a wide vocal range, no one song sounding like the other, how does it feel to be compared to Grace Slick? Who are your influences?</p>
        <p><strong>NV:</strong> I have loads of influences. I love Bjork, Tina Turner, Karen O, Chan Marshall, Natasha Cahn, Janis Joplin, Robert Plant, Stevie Nicks, the list is endless. I just sing what's in my heart. Always.  </p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>You have such an energy and ability to captivate a room when on stage, You recently said after performances “I don't feel like the person who just performed was me.” What did you mean by this? How does your stage persona differ from the real you?</p>
        <p><strong>NV:</strong> First off, thank you. I always feel that something is coming through me on stage verses coming from me. It's a part of me. I feel less insecure when I am on stage than when I am off stage. I don't know why. I think it's because I have a purpose on stage, and in normal life, I am plagued with obsessive human dilemma.   </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What do you guys usually do after a show? </p>
        <p><strong>NV: </strong>Usually meet people, rest my voice and meditate. It's not very interesting. But the boys tend to explore the late night scene more than me. I occasionally join them. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How do you guys feel you have evolved as a band as the momentum and popularity has been picking up?<img src="../images/issue 2/nicovega/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="248" height="108" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p><strong>NV:</strong> We get better the more we play. And we stay true to what we feel as artists. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How do you feel you as a band challenge conformity?</p>
        <p><strong>NV:</strong> By being honest, and by insisting on staying true to what we feel as artists. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Later when you guys look back at your life, what about this experience and opportunity do you think you will take with you?</p>
        <p><strong>NV:</strong> I think we will have been grateful for every adventure. And the memories and friends we have picked up along the way will be there forever to show for it.  </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What’s next for you guys?</p>
        <p><strong>NV: </strong>Your guess is as good as mine. </p>
