          spinning from MADISON/CHICAGO/PHILLY/NYC</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did you get into DJing?</p>
          <p><strong> OCD Automatic: </strong>I've always been drawn to music creation, but I think the real trigger for DJing was discovering the ability to take different parts of songs that complimented each other, and put them together while keeping everything in time. That might be an over complicated way of saying &quot;I made some mashups,&quot; but it quickly led to more traditional DJing, including playing house parties and later bars and clubs.<img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/ocd.jpg" alt="ocd" width="403" height="604" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
<p><strong>amfm:</strong> How long have you been a DJ?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>3-4 years? Not very long!</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What kind of music do you spin?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>Now I mostly play house, some electro, but mostly disco/funk/soul-influenced house and what some people call &quot;Neu-Disco.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Why are you obsessively compulsive about disco? What about disco do you like?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD:</strong> I just love the feel good vibe of a lot of the instrumentation and rhythm that came into popularity with the birth of funk and disco, and later the house movement. I love that all of those things are sort of making a comeback in modern dance music, be it house, electro, french house, dubstep, funky, or whatever the case.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What were the other possible DJ names you thought of?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>I've actually never had another DJ name other than OCD Automatic. I spent a lot of time making sure that my first gig (that had an actual flyer) would be with a name that I wouldn't hate a year later! I think during the brainstorming period, it was always a desire to come up with a name that combined my weird human habits with the robotic nature of producing electronic music.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How does DJing the college scene differ from the nightlife scene in the bigger cities you’ve DJed in?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>The &quot;college scene&quot; I think was just a lot more laid back and all about going out and dancing and getting sweaty, and forgetting for a night about all those papers you'd be writing the next day! I feel like in bigger cities, people take them selves much more seriously and I think that can detract from the overall fun of being a part of this industry. It can be good too though. Bigger cities bring in lots of bigger acts which means more opportunities for both growing DJs (opening for big acts, etc) and for fans of those artists (easier access to shows). You get more of that in a place with a bigger music scene like Chicago.</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/ocdpullquote.jpg" alt="ocdpullquote" width="250" height="252" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />amfm:</strong> What have you found difficult about DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD:</strong> I think the hardest part of DJing for me was never what to play or how to get a crowd moving, but learning the business side of things. Being successful as a DJ is as much about being able to market yourself and developing long term relationships, as it is about being able to rock a crowd. Learning to be a good at both is the real challenge.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Describe your first DJ gig. </p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>My first legitimate gig was opening for Diamonds (Asher from The Glamour, out of Milwaukee) at Cafe Montmartre in Madison. I practiced for weeks for that single show. There were people dancing on top of the bar. I felt pretty good about it.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What’s better-house parties or clubs? Why?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>Well there are huge trade-offs for both. House parties are great because they're intimate, raw, and there are no rules, but some times things get broken or stolen and the sound system is almost always terrible. Clubs are great because usually the equipment is of higher quality, the sound system is booming, and you can pack in more people. But its harder to get that intimate feel going in a larger space such as a club or live venue.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How does older music inspire you to do new things musically?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD: </strong>As with most people, I think the music that I was exposed to as a kid really has had a major influence on the sounds that I try to incorporate into my current work, but even some things that I wasn't exposed to as much of as a kid have had a huge impact on my work.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/indiequeer.jpg" alt="indie queer" width="251" height="260" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />For instance, some of my biggest influences right now, classic chicago house and Italo disco, are things I’ve only really been exposed to in the last 4-5 years. I also spent a large majority of my childhood living in small-town Wisconsin, so none of my peers were really listening to the same music that I was. I sort of accidentally discovered a lot of experimental electronic music like Aphex Twin and Squarepusher on my own. All of my friends thought that stuff was too weird, so most of my musical exposure throughout high school was based purely on what I could dig up on the internet or on my own.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How obsessed were you with your debut mixtape “30 Minute Obsession?” </p>
          <p><strong>OCD:</strong> Very! I spent a considerable amount of time tweaking the mixes and transitions on that mix almost to the point of absurdity. I think it payed off though because I still to this day get positive comments on that mix! Now though, I'm trying to translate that attention to detail to my production.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How has Indie Queer impacted you and your DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>OCD:</strong> The whole iQ movement was a huge blessing for me, because it really gave me a great outlet and community to quickly grow as a DJ. Really it was the draw of iQ combined with my circle of friends that made Discotech so amazing. Sometimes it really felt like a house party with all my friends, but with a huge sound system and a bar!</p>
          <p>I think iQ really helped shape who I am as a DJ now. It taught me a lot of invaluable lessons in a very short time, like how to really draw a crowd in with music they know while still being able to break new stuff, all while keeping the dance floor bouncing.</p>
          <p>I think for a lot of DJs that don't get the opportunity to play to a crowd of that size and with that energy on a regular basis, it takes a lot longer to learn those things and to be dynamic and versatile, and not just be a human iPod playlist.</p>
