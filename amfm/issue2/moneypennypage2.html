        <p class="style4">FROM DJS TO DUO CONTINUED</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/moneypennypress.jpg" alt="moneypenny" width="425" height="634" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />“Being physically attractive and a woman in this DJ world has its advantages and will open certain doors, but it does come with a lot of false assumptions and prejudices at the same time,” Hubbard says. “People assume you get booked just because you are a girl, and if you are physically attractive it makes them even more skeptical of your skills and knowledge.”</p>
<p>Gonyea and Hubbard aren’t DJing to look hot, they just happen to look hot while doing what they’re good at. Gonyea admits that being female DJs does have it’s perks, but it also has it’s jerks, like the person who asked them to DJ topless. “I'm pretty sure no one's ever asked A-Trak or Bad Boy Bill to DJ in a thong,” Gonyea says. </p>
          <p>Gonyea and Hubbard definitely have the chops whether they have to prove it or not. They spin power tracks, and create power tracks. The electro-pop song “Christine” is one of them. Inspired by Stephen King’s 1987 awesomely bad horror movie, Christine, it was one of the first tracks the two laid down together. With Hubbard’s mad DJ skills and Gonyea’s sultry voice and catchy lyrics, your body can’t help but begin moving in sync.          </p>
          <p>Without the “safety net of DJing,” the two hope that the crowd enjoys their live sets as Moneypenny just as much as they would their DJ sets. “Live is a little more stressful for me since I feel like people are concentrating on me and my performance  rather than just concentrating on dancing and getting into the music,” Hubbard says. </p>
<p>“With DJing, if the crowd isn't feeling what you're giving them, you can always throw on Prince,” Gonyea says. “Performing live is a lot more personal. You have to make someone feel the music even if they've never heard it before.”</p>
          <p>It’s been a transformation creating their own original content. Now instead of mixing and mashing other people’s music, their friends and other DJs are mixing their music. With that, they try to approach every song with that thought. <img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="266" height="131" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
          <p>“I think it makes us appreciate both sides of the spectrum and it drives us to create songs that we want people to DJ out,” Hubbard says. “When a fellow DJ wants a track of ours to play out, it is the biggest compliment possible.”</p>
          <p>“If one of our friends says they made an amazing mash-up with our song, or that it killed the night before, it's the best feedback imaginable,” Gonyea adds.</p>
          <p>Moneypenny has been getting nothing but good feedback. They have had the opportunity to play some great stages, like the San Francisco Popscene stage, and Lollapalooza in 2009 was only their third live performance. The two shows they played before that were warm-ups for the music fest, so the show was an unveiling of their new venture. Considering Moneypenny was just kicking off, they wanted stand out and make their performance worthwhile for  the audience amongst a sea of other acts.          </p>
          <p><img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/moneypennylolla.jpg" alt="lolla" width="385" height="250" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />“Lollapalooza was great. Since it was such an early show in our career, we had a million things to think about,” Gonyea says. “To take a little bit of pressure off us, we decided to incorporate dancers and costumes. Feedback was great, we had a much bigger crowd than I had anticipated.”          </p>
          <p>
      Now it’s 2010, and Moneypenny has just added South By Southwest to their stage list. For Hubbard, SXSW is always a good time because it’s in her hometown of Austin. They played one live show, a couple of DJ sets, and even got to shoot part of a music video, all in between Gonyea trying not to be starstruck. </p>
          <p>“One of the funny things at SXSW is the random celebs who attend I had to restrain myself from jumping into Janeane Garofalo's arms at one point,” Gonyea says.   </p>
          <p>Pretty soon their fans will have to restrain themselves from jumping into their arms. Gonyea and Hubbard are busy at work on writing more songs, an EP release, and getting their label off the ground. There’s much more to come in the future from these two, and of course more duck fat fries to be had. </p>
