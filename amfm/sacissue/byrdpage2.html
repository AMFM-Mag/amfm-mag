        <strong><img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/wisk.jpg" alt="wisk" width="254" height="427" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />amfm: </strong>How did you start getting approached to do pieces like the bench in front of Ink, the whisk at house and the art in District 30?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> Well usually it's a friend whose friend is looking to have some art made for this or that. Naturally I think in large scale, and so when we sit down to talk about these projects they are usually caught off guard by how much more I want for their original idea. I love taking a loose idea and creating something much larger and more involved. </p>
        <p>When Chris Nestor approached about creating some pieces for House, the idea started off as big silverware hanging over the dinning area and by the time I was done with it it, it had turned into a 30 ft, 100 pound kitchen whisk. I don't really know how to think small.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What kinds of things inspire you? A lot of your mixed media pieces involve people. How do you evolve these people through the use of metal? Are these people you know? What about portraits do you like?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD: </strong>Life's richness inspires me and people are just so interesting that I can't help but use them as my subjects. A tree is a tree. A river scene is just a river. An abstract painting of city is still just a city. I am moved so much more by a mysterious glace from a stranger or a warm smile on a weathered face than any inanimate objects or collective space.</p>
        <p> A world with out deep interest in others doesn't make sense to me. My metal doesn't carry as much of that thought process because metal is more of an energy conductor to me. It zaps you with whatever thought was in my head when I created it. With my portraits it's more of a capture. Getting that one amazing moment to freeze and save so <img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote2" width="260" height="241" align="right" /> it can be re-enjoyed or re-felt over and over.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did where you grew up open up the doors of your artistic side? How has it influenced your work? How did growing up there shape you as an artist and person?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> Like I said, Sacramento is where I've grown up and having been through most of what you can in this town it has definitely left an impression on me. Crack, gangs, violence, poverty, and Saturday morning cartoons were all happening in my world in the '80s. Sacramento hasn't been the best artist avenue but it has made me approach life with more appreciation for what matters and I believe that helps in the creative process.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What is your favorite medium to use and why? Which do you think you are able to express yourself the most as an artist?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> Honestly I don't have a favorite medium. I don't even really think in terms of specifics like that. Everything is potentially useful for art and I try to stay away from to much of one thing these days. Right now I'm terribly interested in using taxidermy and vintage clothing for my next show.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> If you could do anything with your art what would you do? What is your dream piece to do on a grandeur scale?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD: </strong>My dream piece would have to be some kind of enclosed installation project that you walk or crawl through. Completely affect a persons senses and excite their mind. I'm big on experiences. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What do you think it means to be an artist?<img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/byrdhair2.jpg" alt="byrdhair2" width="320" height="471" align="right" /></p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> I'm an all around creative person and art for me, it's just an exaggeration of my day to day. It's not a need so much as a reflex. Ideas just pop in and then I get anxiety if they aren't realized. It's kind of like wanting to go to a place after seeing pictures of it. It's in your head until you actually go, but if you never do you won't die or anything. </p>
        <p>I had my aha moment when I was at CalArts and I was in this huge sculpture studio up on a ladder. I was listening to my head phones and wrapping tree bark around this 10 foot figure I was working on when it hit me that I could do this and be happy with it for the rest of my life.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Why do you make art?  </p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> I don't know that I think it means much until I meet someone who isn't artistic or creative at all and then I wonder how they get through life. Most people are artists in one way or another. It really comes down to doing what comes naturally to you or doing something else. Why you wouldn't express yourself from time to time in a thought out way never makes sense to me. I think there would be much less violence and negativity in this world if people didn't wait til they were exploding to express themselves.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Are you working on anything right now? What's next for Matt Byrd?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> I'm about ready to bust from all these ideas swarming in my head, art ideas I mean. I really want to do a big show here downtown in Febuary or March. I am looking for a large studio space to work out of now so it's just a matter of time.</p>
