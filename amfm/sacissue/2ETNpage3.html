      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How is 2ETN a part of the green movement? and part of your proceeds go to a buffalo ranch? </p>
        <p><strong>2ETN: </strong>2ETN uses only reclaimed or recycled material. We source locally when we can, and try to only buy made in USA. Even our boxes are made by a family back East. We also believe that precious stones and metals are not the sole element from which jewelry derives its value. This belief and deep interest and respect of Native American culture informs the philosophy behind our jewelry.</p>
        <p>2ETN gives a portion of our proceeds to The Village Earth Adopt-a-Buffalo campaign <a href="http://www.villageearth.org">www.villageearth.org.</a> My husband and I are greatly influenced by Native American philosophy. We want to honor the fact that the Native Americans were the first indigenous people on this continent. By contributing to the revival of this Native industry we feel we are giving back to the resources (and people) we have taken advantage of.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/2etnshoot.jpg" alt="shoot" width="566" height="377" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />amfm:</strong> What story do you want to tell with 2ETN?</p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> We mostly want to tell story of beauty and grace and courage and respect.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> You just finished up a new line, and some new photography for it, how has the response been? How long did it take? What was the inspiration behind this?  </p>
        <p><strong>2ETN: </strong>The new shoot came about because we are also designing many pieces for men now and work that can be worn by both men &amp; women, hence the WO + MEN addition to our collections page. With exception of the Eisenberg Pieces, most of our work could be worn by either sex. The reaction has been very positive thus far. <br />
           <br />
          <strong>amfm:</strong> What’s next for 2ETN? </p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> We are always looking for ways to collaborate with other designers. Locally we love working with Van De Neer. Ideally we would love to have a show of our work and have local musicians like Sister Crayon and Sea of Bees play, ideally taking that show on the road. Wouldn’t that be amazing? </p>
<p>We always like to use live models in our show..and works from Fashion Designers. Last year we did a show with Gail Chovan/for Blackmail Atelier called “13”. She used our work again  in a show called “14” and  took our work with her to the El Cosmico festival in Marfa.</p>
        <p>2ETN is also beginning an outreach campaign with hopes to have one store/gallery in each major city (or not major depending on if there is interest in our work or not!), ideally six or so pieces in 10 or so locations throughout the US and hopefully Paris, London…even working on a store in Japan.</p>
