        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/cloudnine/coowners.jpg" alt="cloudnine" width="342" height="219" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />Years later, a friend, and now business partner Shawn Kahan approached him and suggested that they start a line together, and thus Cloud Nine was born. </p>
        <p>The first t-shirt design they made together, Hella Trees, was simple and to the point, a play on the city they lived in, Sacramento, the city of trees. </p>
        <p>Day said people thought it was clever enough to buy, an impetus enough to boost their confidence to continue forward with their clothing line. </p>
        <p>Now they have taken their tree concept in a new direction that is rooted in the community with their new “Tee for a Tree campaign” designed to give back. For every &quot;tee for a tree&quot; shirt they sell, they will plant a tree in the Sacramento area.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/cloudnine/tiedye.jpg" alt="tiedye" width="224" height="178" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />A sense of community and giving back is very important to this collective. Last winter they teamed up with Starbucks and an elementary school for a coat drive and collected over 125 coats for kids in need. They also held an outdoor tie-dye workshop for their “Summer of Love” campaign.</p>
        <p>“We feel that not enough young people give back to their community so we do about four things a year to help give kids a chance to give back to their community,” Day said. “The earlier the age that kids start to give back the better the world will be,” he said. </p>
        <p>Day is helping make the world  a better place with one t-shirt design at a time, and Sacramento is a better place because of Cloud Nine Clothing. Up in the clouds seems like a good place to be. </p>
