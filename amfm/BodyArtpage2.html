          <p class="content">20  year old Jasmine Nichols also thinks of tattoos as a way of accessorizing with  your body. &quot;The person’s wearing it,&quot; Nichols says. &quot;It’s like a  permanent piece of clothing—really cool clothing,&quot; she said. If Nichols  would have gotten her way when she was 13, she would have a permanent <em>Hello  Kitty </em>accessory on her arm. &quot;I'm glad they don't let 13 year olds get  tattoos for that reason,&quot; she said. <br />
          </p>
          <p class="content"><img src="images/Body Art/jared.jpg" width="338" height="253" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />The  ideas are a big part of the reason people keep coming back. Some do it for the  &quot;unleashing of creativity,&quot; while others find that the pain actually  feels good. Skolmolski thinks they feel good. Tattoos aren't really as painful  as most would think. They can be depending on where you get them, but it almost  becomes a dulling pain, like continually scratching a safety pin on your skin  for a good 30 plus minutes—you get used to the feeling. Jared Linzmeier finds  the <img src="images/Body Art/pullquote4.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />experience rather enjoyable. <br />
          </p>
          <span class="content">&quot;I  think something about the pain and the needles will continue to have a sort of  sick pleasure as so many other aspects of our lives become less personally  interactive,&quot; Linzmeier says. &quot;I personally enjoy getting to know my  tattoo artists and find the experience soothing, and spiritual,&quot; he says.</span>
          <p class="content">Tattooing  has actually been around for over 200,000 years dating back to mummification  where evidence of sharp bone needles were discovered. Tattoos have been common  in various different cultures and tribes—Native American, Japanese, Egyptian  and so on. As a form of ritual scarification, tattoos were viewed as a  spiritual act that references common religious themes of pain and suffering.  The word &quot;tattoo&quot; is said to come from the Samoan word  &quot;tatau.&quot; For Samoans, getting a tattoo ties one to their culture, and  they have been doing these traditional practices on men and women for over  2,000 years, and even still today.<br />
            <br />            
            &quot;In the South Seas islands they’re a warrior culture,&quot; Jansen  explains. &quot;So like, in Samoa they have this thing called the pe'a. It’s a traditional pair of shorts that  men get from just below the knee to just above the waist and it [is]  <img src="images/Body Art/pe'a.jpg" width="265" height="176" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />excruciating. And, you know, living in the subtropics with an open wound, I  mean a staph infection, it was really easy to die from these things, so if you  survived it that just proved how strong you were in the tribe,&quot; he said. <br />
  <br />
            Those that couldn't withstand the pain were disgraced with the mark of shame or  &quot;matu pe'a.” Women are even put to the test. A woman's pe'a is referred to  a &quot;malu.&quot; Some of these traditional tattoos, like a full pe'a, could  take as long as three days to execute. Some can take weeks, years even. Most of  these types of tattoos were done completely by hand using crafted tools from  tusks or bone. Some traditional Borneoan tattooes use two sticks for the hand tapping method.  They stretch the skin and tap a needle  or sharp stick into the skin, while using the other as a hammer to tap in the  ink.&nbsp; Both the Bornean  and the Samoan pe'a and malu tattoos represent rites of passage to  indicate an embarking on man and womanhood, and to show pride and identity. <br />
  <br />
            Perhaps this is what drives so many 18 year olds get a tattoo when they have  reached legal adulthood. Some people have<img src="images/Body Art/jasmine.jpg" width="243" height="279" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /> been anticipating their ink for  years.&nbsp; Nichols got her first tattoo when she was 18. <br />
  <br />  &quot;I’ve been drawing&nbsp;on myself since forever and I started with the  temporary tattoos,&quot; Nichols says. I think turning 18 was like, I can  finally get a real one. I’ve always wanted one; I always thought they were  really beautiful. The fact that someone could be that committed to something to  put [it] on their body forever—I like that idea.&quot;<br />
  <br />
            Her parents, who she describes as &quot;total hippies&quot; were fine with the  idea of their daughter getting tattoos. They always let her do her own thing.  Her grandparents on the other hand didn't quite share the same ideology. She  admits that she's been hiding her arm tattoo from them. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I think they would have an issue with the visibility. Every time I go to  their house I’d wear long sleeves—even in the summer,&quot; Nichols says. <br />
  <br />
            <img src="images/Body Art/pullquote3.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />One of the big reasons people have a problem with tattoos is because of their  visibility, and tastefulness. Skolmoski believes in freedom of expression. Jobs  have been known to have tattoo discrimination or specific covering  requirements. <br />
            </p>
          <p class="content">“I think  it’s a shame for people to hide their tattoos. Not that people would ask them  to, but that they would put themselves in a position where they had to,”  Skolmolski says. “Why would I work a job that won’t respect me for expressing  myself?” <img src="images/Body Art/sammi.jpg" width="235" height="352" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /><br />
          </p>
          <p class="content">Miki  Mulaney, 20, doesn't have any tattoos. She says she would get one, but the only  thing she would want permanently on her body is her family's insignia. Although  she doesn't have any tattoos, she can understand why people might feel employers shouldn’t  discriminate, but she can also see where the  employer might potentially be coming from. <br />
            <br />
            &quot;I think a lot of people stereotype tattoos as being edgier or trying to  rebel against society,&quot; Mulaney says. &quot;And, that might make the  employer or other people they’ll encounter think they’ll fight them on every  issue or cause that comes up.&quot;<br />
            <br />
            Her friend Cameron Thain, 20, who is sitting across from her, interjects  saying, &quot;As long as your tattoo doesn’t interfere with your job. If you’re  dealing with customers who might perceive you in the wrong way because you have  a tattoo, then I understand how that’s like important,&quot; Thain says.&nbsp;  &quot;But if you’re just dealing with people in personnel over the phone or  with your co-workers, that’s fine. I think it’s more with older people—they  don’t like tattoos.&quot; </p>
          <span class="content"> Like  his parents, who he says really hate tattoos. A number of his siblings have  tattoos. He doesn't have any. “All my siblings that have tattoos my parents  hate all of them! Not the siblings, but the tattoos,&quot; he said. </span><br />
