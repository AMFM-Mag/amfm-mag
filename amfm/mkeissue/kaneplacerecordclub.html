      <p><strong>Kane Place Record Club</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The six piece high energy big band sounds of the Kane Place Record Club has been gracing Milwaukee stages for about three years now. The band (John Scott-vocals/keys, Francis Sullivan- guitar/piano, Nick Tovarek- guitar, Chad Alsteen- saxophone/electric violin, Eris Campbell- bass, and Maurice Liddell- drums) is a melding of different individuals and different tastes that infused together make up a truly unique sound equipped with an electric violin, a bass, guitar, keys, a saxophone and even sometimes a tambourine. KPRC is a little bit of funk, mixed with indie rock, &nbsp;some soul, and that big sound like that of New Orleans that makes you want to get on your feet, jump around, and dance with elation.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">No stage is big enough to encapsulate the big sound of Kane Place Record Club.They really have a great stage presence and you can tell that this is something that they really enjoy by the pure joy they exude when performing. What started out as a record club hangout turned into much more when they realized that they had more in common than a love for classic records, but that they actually wanted to make music together as well. They released their self titled debut album last year and are currently in the works of their follow up set to record this summer.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">amfm: </strong>You used to have a record listening club? What did those nights look like? Do you guys still do that?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">Kane Place Record Club: </strong>We did get together and listen to records. Nick (our guitar player) had some pretty decent speakers hooked up to his turntable, so we would just bring over some beer and a couple of records and hang out. He lived in a studio apartment on Kane place. I remember the first record we listened to was a Grant Green album. These days &quot;record club&quot; meet ups are rare, but every once and a while we still get together. Honestly, it is like in the movie &quot;The Breakfast Club.&quot; We were for a minute the Kane Place Record Club in the same way that all those individuals meeting for detention were the &quot;Breakfast Club.&quot; A group of random people brought together that realized they had more in common than they initially thought. It was the idea of the event that we took the name from. It was a group of friends just talking to each other, opening up about music and life. We could have very well called ourselves &quot;Kane Place Talk about Girls Club,&quot; but we thought that was too long, haha. We all bond over the classics, but then take inspiration from what we dig on from certain styles and artists.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">amfm: </strong>How did the six of you go from friends and sharing music to actually forming the band and making music together? Was there a conversation or did you just jam out one day?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">KPRC: </strong>So the record club is the name of a meeting of a couple individuals. The band formed out of the ambition to start making music. There was a desire to start a band outside of the record club. We weren't just sitting in a room and then all of a sudden said, &quot;shoot, let's go make some music.&quot; The band developed separately from the record club really. Only three of us were really in Nick's house listening to music together. We aren't like The Strokes where the guys look like they are wearing the same clothes and grew up listening to the same music haha. We are all pretty different people.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">amfm: </strong>You have a ton of musical talent and quite a few instruments, keys, sax, and even an electric violin. How do these add to your music and live shows? You guys are often known for giving great live shows that have this big band feel, what's that energy like?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">KPRC: </strong>One of our biggest concerns as a band is arrangements. Since we do have a fairly large band, it is easy to get too crowded with instrumentation. We have all of these flavors available to us, but who wants to eat strawberry, peach, vanilla, blueberry, and cherry garcia at the same time? What we have learned, and are still learning, as a band is how to arrange. Let people breathe on their instrument. As far as the energy during our live performances, it is a really fun thing to be a part of. We like putting on a show, and we have a fun group to do that. You can usually always look over your shoulder to see someone smiling at you, and that is a great feeling. (Although I have thrown a harmonica at people's heads on accident, and then the smiles aren't always there haha.)<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">KPRC: </strong>What do you guys think of this momentum picking up in the Milwaukee music scene? How has it been for you guys being a popular band during this time and being young in Milwaukee?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">KPRC: </strong>Milwaukee really is gaining some presence with its music. It is fun and exciting to be a part of. Milwaukee is fun, if you know where to go at the right time. I think a level of creativity is budding that hasn't been seen in a while. It even goes outside the music scene, but they all tie together. Things such as the Milwaukee Underwear Bike Ride has grown in popularity and it brings the community together. So many people are taking things into their own hands to get things going. The clubs, the promoters, the bands, etc. Sometimes it is slightly guerilla style, but that is super fun. We are really thankful for all of the love we have received in Milwaukee. &nbsp;<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6c2308ce-b61b-4d68-7cff-d4c19c752550">amfm: </strong>There's talk that you're working on a second album? Can you talk a bit about that, what can people expect? Are you going to lock yourselves away in a barn again? What's next for you guys?<br />
        <br />
        <strong>KPRC:</strong> The new album is underway. We tracked the last one at Chrome Attic in Illinois with the talented Jonathan Alvin. It was such a fun experience and we are definitely going to go back there again. The last album was a collection of songs that were written over a long period of time. With the new album, we are writing it in a more compact amount of time, which I think will give it a more consistent feel. This album is definitely going to be dirtier and grimier than before. We are all really excited to lock ourselves in that barn again. So, what is next with the band is continue writing. Hopefully we will hit the studio in June or July. At the same time we are lucky to have some really great gigs this summer in Milwaukee. We will be playing the Summer Soulstice festival June 21st and we are currently working on putting a great show together for that event.<br />
