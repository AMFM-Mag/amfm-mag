      <p><strong>Fresh Cut Collective</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Fresh Cut Collective is no stranger to the scene, but they are always keeping things fresh. They have been around since 2008, and have been constantly evolving their sound and their band since then. Sometimes they are a one man band, sometimes they are seven plus members. Regardless of how many members there are in the band at a given time, they know how to entertain a crowd. </p>      Their music, like their name, is an amalgamation of many musical styles that influence the members who all come from different realms of the musical world, ranging from hip hop, to jazz and classical, to rock and world. Music being a universal language is something that will bring anyone together, but Fresh Cut Collective has a way of bringing the community together through their uplifting music one beat at a time. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>How did you guys get your name? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fresh cut collective: </strong>Whenever a group of musicians gets together and decides they're a band, the absolute hardest thing is thinking of a band name. You want it to be something that conveys who you are as people, as musicians, and as a group. You want it to communicate some aesthetic or vibe or essence. You want it to sound cool and stand out. You want it to be Google-able. We were under extra pressure because we had our first show coming up and we still didn't have a name. We finally decided on The Cream City Collective because we were a collective of musicians from Milwaukee, the Cream City--not very creative, but the alliteration was working working for us and we wanted to rep our city. We had all been playing in groups and as solo artists in Milwaukee and the surrounding areas for years and we were looking for something new to do--most of us were friends already and some of us had played in previous bands together too. I made posters for our first show with &quot;Cream City Collective&quot; on it, and while I was putting them up, I came to find out that Cream City Collective was a name already in use… so back to the drawing board. We wanted to keep &quot;collective&quot; in the name and eventually we landed on Fresh Cut Collective because we make &quot;fresh cuts&quot;, we're so &quot;fresh&quot; and so clean &quot;cut&quot;, we brighten up your day and smell good like some &quot;fresh cut&quot; flowers or some &quot;fresh cut&quot; french fries… LOL, I dunno, a name is a name, you pick one and you go with it. Luckily, Fresh Cut Collective rolls off the tongue and it has a good abbreviation, FCC. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>In what way you feel like a collective?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>We're a group of people working together to make something happen for the benefit of all involved and those around us. Everyone contributes and varying levels, but everyone's contribution matters and is necessary to keep the whole moving. We're not just a band or a group of friends. We have a bigger picture in mind- we bring all of our creative energies and talents to the table, not only music, but visual art, dance, video, web design, fashion, education, activism, and entrepreneurialism. Our goal is to continue being creative, to continue following our passion while being able to support ourselves and each other, financially, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually, to build something that is greater than the sum of its parts. Something that will make a positive impact on our community, and all the people our music, word, and efforts touch. <br />

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>How did you guys get together and decide to form the band? &nbsp;</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>Former FCC guitar player, Paul Trinko, and I had just disbanded our trio, Fly Neurotic, and had plans to start a live hip-hop group (The Roots were one of my favorite bands and had been since I was in middle school). At the time, I was the doorman at Stonefly, and they were having a lot of hip hop shows there--all the up-and-coming acts and artists were performing there regularly: Haz Solo, Prophetic and the whole UMG crew, House of M, Dana Coppa and the Uni-Fi crew, Adi Amour, and plenty of young acts from the Northside and suburbs. Because I had come up playing in bands, I didn't have much knowledge of the local hip-hop scene, but working at Stonefly at that time was a great way for me to meet a lot of people and build some relationships. I reached out to a lot of people, told them about my plans to start a band, but no one really seemed that interested. One day, Adebisi walked up and said hello to some people I knew who were out there. He was talking about music, so I asked him if he was a DJ, and he said &quot;Naw, man, I'm an emcee extraordinaire.&quot; I never saw him perform, but we got to talking and he seemed really interested in the band idea. He had been performing as a solo artist for a long time and was looking for a change of pace, a new musical venture. We exchanged numbers. He called me within a couple days and was like &quot;What's up, when you want to meet up and play with the band?&quot; At that point, it was only me and Paul, so I wasn't sure what to say, but I was excited by Adebisi's eagerness, so we set up some times to get together and listen to music and talk and jam. For the first few months, I was playing drums, and Paul and our friend, Allen Russell (former violin player in FCC) were making loops with guitar and violin. Adebisi would freestyle for hours and hours while we jammed and made loops. That was a great way for us to get some chemistry going before we were officially a band. Soon we brought on Patricio Amerena, who Paul, Allen, and I knew from the music department at UWM. We continued to improvise and develop our sound, until one day, Adebisi said enough jamming, time to book a show. He had a lot of material on his own, but if we were going to play a show we needed a real drummer (I play keys normally) and a bass player. I brought on Paul Fleming, who I played with in my first band in Milwaukee, the house band at the Up and Under, who was also a fellow UWM music student and was playing bass in John the Savage, and Michael Stewart who was one of the top drummers in the scene. Our first show was at Stonefly December 18, 2008. We played some of Adebisi&rsquo;s material, some new material we had worked on together, and some covers. Because we came together like Voltron, all from different parts of the music scene, we also brought together all our friends and fans into one big party. That first show was a smash hit, and I haven't looked back since. <br />

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>How would you describe your dynamic/sound/style of hip hop? Is it hip hop? Why do you not like to be pigeonholed into a genre?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>Musically speaking, hip-hop attracts me the most because it's a combination of every genre. You can take elements, samples, and ideas from Bach, Led Zeppelin, Miles Davis, and traditional music from India and put them all together in one song. All the guys in the group and I have very broad tastes in music… sometimes I want to get ig'nant with 2 Chainz, sometimes I want to get pensive with Bob Dylan, sometimes I want to get far out with Sun Ra or The Flaming Lips. There are different musics for different days, times, and moods, and we fully indulge in all, appreciating what each has to offer. As an artist, whether you're a musician, painter, or even a chef, having a diverse palette is important. Sure, cheesecake is good, but what if you had to eat it everyday for every meal? The only way for us to keep things fresh and exciting is to keep on moving around, trying new things, learning new skills/styles. Because we have all these influences, it's impossible not to let them find their way into our music. I never sit down to write a song and say, &quot;I'm going to make a hip hop or a rock song today.&rdquo; You have to let the music be what it wants to be, the labels come after the fact, and in most cases, the labels are insufficient or misleading. I want to be free to honestly express myself based on a given moment, not based on a style or genre. Relying on genre labels prevents us from really listening to the music. It divides us as artists, and when we get pigeonholed and feel like we have to keep repeating ourselves over and over, it kills our creative spirit. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>Why is making music so important to you? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc:</strong> I've been doing this for so long, I don't know what else I would do. Music is my connection to the world, and it's also my escape from the world. Making music has opened my mind and my heart, it helps me feel like I have a purpose. Making music, like life, is a quest to find oneself and to re-unify that self with something greater. Music is visceral, emotional, spiritual, social, intellectual, and most importantly is FUN! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>How has Fresh Cut evolved since making your first album and doing shows around Milwaukee?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>We are constantly evolving, new members, different instrumentations, more connections, more wisdom and experiences. The biggest change that we've pushed for over the past year or so, is to not just be a confined band with a fixed singer and fixed members and set songs, but to be a true collective, a company, a conglomerate, a community. We've expanded. We all have our own projects and ventures and talents we work together to push and develop all of them. Some people leave the group for a little while, then they come back, different people sit in with us at different times, sometimes we're a ten piece, sometimes we're a trio. Most of the time we're recording and performing music, but we also teach music, dance, and art classes. We make music videos, documentaries, animations, web sites, and clothing. We stay on our grind as much as possible in as many ways as possible and we move it forward under the name Fresh Cut Collective. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>Kiran once said after getting a taste of success, especially in Milwaukee, you can get too caught up in the business side of things and it started to mess with your process, what is your process of making music?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>I'll refer you to Paulo Coelho's <a href="http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2008/07/24/the-creative-process-2/" target="_blank">&quot;The Creative Process&quot; </a>because, for me, it says it all. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>What has been your most memorable show?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>Opening for The Roots at Summerfest. 5000+ people, but it was also the perfect crowd because they were obviously into live hip-hop if they were there waiting for The Roots. The weather was perfect, we were feeling and playing great, all of our friends were up on stage and back stage with us. I'll never forget the crowd chanting &quot;one more song, one more song,&quot; after our last song. Like I said above, the band was basically started because of my love for The Roots, and here we were not only sharing the stage with them, but holding that isn down! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>Kiran, what does it mean to you to have been named most influential Milwaukeean in arts and culture? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">kiran:</strong> It means that I, along with my partners and supporters, have the responsibility to make shit go down in Milwaukee! LOL…Being named most influential inspired me to actually become that. I work with young people, but I also want to be an inspiration to all artists/people in Milwaukee. It's very hard to make something real happen here, but I feel like we're on the verge, and I plan to give my all, and when I get it, I plan to give it all back. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>Describe your alter ego, who is Bellse Soneek and how is he different than Kiran?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">kiran: </strong>I think every artist needs at least one alter-ego. Kiran Vedula is the person, the student, the educator; Kiran Vee is the writer, the musician, the band leader, Bellse Soneek (pronounced Bell-Say-Saw-Neek) is the producer, mad scientist, explorer, time traveler, philosopher who reports back to Mr. Vedula and K. Vee. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>Christopher gilbert was a new addition to the group, what kind of dynamic does he add to Fresh Cut? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc:</strong> Of course, everyone knows Chris for his dancing and his public persona, but he is also an excellent percussionist. We added him to the group on the electronic drum pad, playing congas, 808s, claps, and it has added a wonderful layer to our music. It gives us more options sonically, and it makes the grooves tighter and more danceable. I've always wanted to have a percussionist in the band to add to the drums. Now that we have it, I don't think I could go back. Chris has also been an influence on me in terms of my hustle because he is always about business, taking things to the next level, building good relationships, working hard. His professional experiences in LA and otherwise, along with his overall mindset, energy, and passion have inspired me and everyone in the group to go in even harder. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">amfm: </strong>What do you love about Milwaukee? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>Milwaukee is my home and home is very important to me. Everything I care about is here. <br />

      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">fcc: </strong>Matt Gorski and Steven Look are, in my eyes Milwaukee music legends. They were first known for their band, Meteah Strike, then later for Fable and the World Flat. They have been at it for so long, performing and putting out projects, and each time around, they get better and better. Fable and the World Flat put out an album in 2009, <em>Ladies and Gentlemen</em>, that was a smash hit locally, but due to a variety of factors, they couldn't continue as a band. I've known them for a while as fellow musicians and friends playing around the city, and in 2010 I was delighted to bring Matt onboard as drummer for FCC. While playing with us, Matt continued to work with Steve in the studio. At the beginning of this year, 2013, Steve joined FCC on bass. We didn't have any new material, so for a few months FCC was doing a set of roller disco funk music. By the time the summer hit, Matt and Steve were ready to release the first of a double album they had been slowly and steadily working on for over a year, <em>The Great Attractor</em>. All of us in FCC were really feeling the material and since both Matt and Steve were now in the group, we decided to turn FCC into Fable's live band and start pushing the new stuff. We've been playing as Fable and the World Flat since the summer and it's been awesome. We feel fresh and confident in the material and our overall chemistry. We plan to put out more videos and go on tour in March. <br />

      <p>f<strong id="docs-internal-guid-77b772a7-3d48-4735-70d9-eb33224990f4">cc: </strong>We have a monthly hip-hop night at Fire on Water (free every month). Every month, we'll be backing a different artist. We will also have a residency at Distill, downtown on Milwaukee St. This will be an instrumental hip-hop/jazz/funk/soul night with a trio (drums, keys, bass) featuring a different lead instrument (guitar, sax, etc) each month. This will happen twice a month, every other Friday. The Distill sets will be primarily improvised and will give us a chance to flex our chops and go outside the box in a chill, classy environment. There will be no cover charge. I love improvising live. There's an energy to it that's so real and in the moment… we feed off the audience, they feed off us, we feed off each other. You'll never hear the same thing twice.<br />
