      <p><strong>Eastside Music Tour</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">The Second Annual Eastside Music Tour put on by Newaukee is back this year March 1st, and is bigger than ever. The nearly sold out event features a slew of local and regional musicians performing at the establishments along Brady Street.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">      There are over 80 bands featured, each bringing an eclectic taste of the music scene in Milwaukee. Klassik, Fresh Cut Collective, and Vic and Gab, all featured in the Milwaukee Issue are performing at the tour, along with FCC side project Fable and the World Flat. Riding the success of the old school vibe and trippy EP Desperate Youth, newcomer Webster X will also be hitting the Rochambo stage alongside other hip-hop acts, Eye.See.You., Dana Coppa &amp; Speakeasy, and Higher Education Records sponsored by Uni-Fi Records. <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">The electro-indie dance music from GGOOLLDD debuted at Blankets, an ART show held at Hotel Foster in November, returns to the stage at Jo-Cat&rsquo;s. Their sound is similar to the likes of the Yeah Yeahs Yeahs and Metric. D&rsquo;Amato will bring his fun funk and soul rap act to Jacks American Pub, sponsored by the Shepherd Express. The Kane Place Record Club brings their Indie-pop, soul meets big band sound, to the 88.9 Radio Milwaukee Outdoor Stage at their new digs, along with DJs Marcus Doucette and Sirius Booty. </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Also at the 88.9 stage is P.O.S., an underground hip-hop emcee and producer out of Minneapolis&rsquo; music collective DoomTree. He is one of the headliners of the tour at the All Access Pass Stage. Why coming out from Ohio is also headlining the tour, playing at Casablanca&rsquo;s new second story space on their All Access Stage sponsored by K-Nation Entertainment. &nbsp; </p>
<p>This year already tops last years&rsquo; sold out tour and is only going to grow. It might just be Milwaukee&rsquo;s second largest music festival. &quot;This years Second Annual Eastside Music Tour is all about making the best of the festival,&rdquo; Danielle Hansen of Newaukee said. &ldquo;Our line up has almost doubled compared to 2013, more businesses are participating and we have nationally recognized All Access Stage acts. I cannot wait for the event and look forward to making it even bigger and better in 2015,&rdquo; she said. </p>
There will literally be music everywhere, even at flower shop Mari&rsquo;s Flowers, restaurants Mai Thai and Trocadero, and stores like Greenfields. Consider it a musical takeover. Art Milwaukee and Newaukee who recently officially joined forces, put this tour together to showcase the breadth of talent in this city, which seems to be a movement gaining a lot of momentum in the city. Especially given that a number of arts will be heading off to SXSW in just a few weeks to show Austin, Texas just what Milwaukee has to offer. <br />
      <p dir="ltr">A free panel discussion, &ldquo;Growing Milwaukee&rsquo;s Music Scene,&rdquo; featuring Milwaukee music industry professionals from WSME, Tap Milwaukee and more, will be held in conjunction with the festival on Thursday at 5pm, which also touches base on that topic. </p>      <p>Each ticket purchased will go towards supporting the local artists and The Brady Street Arts and Culture Fund. A trolley, also with sporadic music performances will be looping Brady street to take people from venue to venue. If you are lucky enough to score a ticket, hop along and let the music begin.</p>
