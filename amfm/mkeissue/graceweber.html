      <p><strong>Grace Weber</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Grace Weber may have left Milwaukee eight years ago to study music in New York, but Milwaukee is her home and her heart. From a young age Weber knew she was going to be a singer, even at the young age of seven when she sang for a second grade talent show and brought her teacher to tears and learned the true power behind the voice. That was the beginning of her journey that has been filled with many stepping stones, including joining a Gospel choir at 11 years old, singing on Oprah,  releasing her first album <em>Hope and Heart,</em> working with the Young Arts Foundation, and now gearing up for the release of her second album &ldquo;The Refinery.&rdquo;</p>
      <p dir="ltr">Weber&rsquo;s journey was not just musical. The more she delved into her music, the road became a way of discovering who she was as an artist, a person, and what she was capable of. &ldquo;The Refinery&rdquo; is about Weber refining herself for herself. It&rsquo;s about the light and the dark side of her gift, and the power of song and letting it all go without restraint. She is a modern day soul singer, smooth like oil, gritty like the streets of New York and hopeful like her Midwestern charm.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>You joined an urban Gospel choir when you were younger? How did you get into gospel?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">Grace Weber: </strong>Well I was always obsessed with soul music when I was younger, and pop, R&amp;B stuff. Boys II Men was my first concert when I was eight, and loved it so much. I loved listening to all the soulful jazz artists, like Diana Washington, Billie Holiday, Etta James, Sara Vaughn, and through listening to that type of music I ended up getting into Lauryn Hill, and eventually I saw Sister Act Two, and I was obsessed with Sister Act Two. That was the first time that I was really exposed to a gospel choir, but I was just so blown away by the sound and the potential for being a part of something like that, so I just put in on my radar. I need to figure out how I can make this happen. Up until that point I had been singing in the Milwaukee Children&rsquo;s Choir and some other choirs through school that were more classical music, which was really a good experience too and I loved it. But when I thought about the potential of being in a gospel choir I felt like this is where I needed to be. So when I was in 6th grade, I was 11 maybe, we were on our retreat, because I went to a Catholic grade school growing up, and this gospel choir walked in and the teachers were like &lsquo;&rsquo;okay we have a surprise for you guys. This is the Central City Youth Choir of Milwaukee&rsquo;&rsquo; and I was like oh my god this is the moment from the Universe of my opportunity to join this choir. It was amazing, and they performed and asked if we had any questions, so I raised my hand and said &ldquo;can I sing for you guys? I really want to join your choir!&rsquo;&rsquo; And so I sang for them, and they all said &lsquo;&rsquo;oh my gosh you should join!&rsquo;&rsquo; So I joined the choir and was a part of this choir for three years, and also through the choir I did We Are The Drum in Milwaukee, which is a show on the history of African American music over the years, and so I was the one little white girl in the choir singing songs from  the 1920&rsquo;s. I met Naima Adedapo through We Are The Drum and through the gospel choir. The community was just so great, and I&rsquo;m glad to have been a part of it. It changed my life, and understanding the power of the human voice. I think that that&rsquo;s what I love so much about gospel music is that there is no restraint really you&rsquo;re just called to let it all out and getting the reaction instantly from the audience, it&rsquo;s unlike anything that I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. So it&rsquo;s pretty cool, and I just joined a gospel choir last week in New York and I&rsquo;m so excited!<br />

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>Was anyone in your life musically inclined? How did you sort of get into music?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber:</strong> My mom&rsquo;s side of the family, a lot of them are musicians. My grandpa was a musician, and he had 10 kids, including my mom, and he made all of them learn an instrument growing up. So I have 25 cousins on that side of the family, so every Christmas and Thanksgiving we&rsquo;d all play music around the piano, and my grandpa would play Christmas songs and we&rsquo;d all sing. There were little mini family bands, so I think it&rsquo;s in my genes to have some music in my life, but that&rsquo;s where it all started when I was three or four. Just this past Thanksgiving, my cousin is in Les Mis, and she&rsquo;s a really talented actor and singer, and we all got a little buzzed now that we&rsquo;re all a bit older now, and for some reason I thought it would be funny to do a short synopsis of Les Mis, and so we put it on and did Les Mis. Totally nerdy and dorky!<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>You were on Oprah also? What was that experience like? How old were you when you were on Oprah<strong>?</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>I was 20 or 21, I was a senior in college. I sort of blacked out during it a little bit because it was so nerve wrecking, but it was great, it was amazing. The experience was incredible, but I was at a time in my life where I was just not ready for that type of exposure in a lot of ways because it was just so terrifying, but it was incredible! The way it happened was that she had a contest where you upload a video to her website and you get a chance to sing on the show. So I did that and completely forgot about it, and then one day Oprah camera crews surprised me, you know  the whole Oprah shebang surprise. Like BB Winans was there singing to me, and it was so crazy! And then they flew me out a week later to sing on the show, which was called Oprah&rsquo;s Karaoke Challenge. It was really great, it was more promoting us as karaoke singers sort of than artists and there were eight of us, so they had words on the screen and it was more like a fun show.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>Why did you decide to go on your own journey with music?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>I mean in a lot of ways the opportunities to go with a label or go with a bigger management company, they weren&rsquo;t really there in the sense of allowing me to develop as an artist. There were some opportunities where they would say &lsquo;&rsquo;yeah we can take you on, but we&rsquo;d really want to control what would go down with your career.&rsquo;&rsquo; At that point I hadn&rsquo;t even really been writing my own music that much, and was still trying to find my voice as an artist. Besides that, there was a lot of hype, people being like &lsquo;&rsquo;you were on Oprah! We have to capitalize on this,&rsquo;&rsquo; but sort of when the dust settles you realize there isn&rsquo;t really anything here…I looked at the situation and thought I need to figure out who I am as an artist before I have this opportunity again. So I kind of went into the shed, and started writing as much as I could and just figuring out what I wanted to do, and it&rsquo;s really been a journey since then. I think that was 2009. I released a record in 2011 and it was a really good experience. I needed to grow and keep learning in order to get to this new album to really have that perspective. For me I sort of felt like I kind of had to go through the industry stuff in order to get a thick skin to just be okay with being myself and be okay with whatever happens. Even if nobody likes it at least I like it. And that&rsquo;s what being an artist is, just being yourself.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm:</strong> What do you think your voice is?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber:</strong> I really came back to just the appreciation of soul and gospel music, and how much I love singing without restraint. For this record that&rsquo;s what I tried to keep as the through line throughout everything. So when I was writing songs, I was not only trying to write songs that were more honest and connected to a deeper part of myself, but also how do I really represent my voice so that the soul comes through. I think just going back to my roots and what I&rsquo;ve always loved is how I realized who I really am as an artist. That&rsquo;s what my high school teacher said. I went to Pius, I did visual arts too. My teacher said always pay attention to what you pay attention to, cause that&rsquo;s what makes you unique. It took me awhile to realize how important that was in regards to y&rsquo;know, just like what you like, and just go with that. It&rsquo;s really simple, but it takes a long time sometimes to really be confident enough to really embrace what you like I think.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>What&rsquo;s the significance of it being called The Refinery?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>The Refinery has two significances. One is that my band that I&rsquo;ve played with for a long time were touring. We were actually on our way down to South by Southwest, and my drummer used to always say that soulful music was oily, like &lsquo;&rsquo;Ooo that&rsquo;s got some oil on it!&rsquo; So we had this thing going on during that tour, talking about things being oily, and we were driving down to Texas and we passed this oil refinery and he&rsquo;s  saying &lsquo;&rsquo;something is so soulful and oily that it&rsquo;s a refinery,&rsquo;&rsquo; and it just always stuck with me. I really liked that. So that was actually what sort of kicked the name around for me. And then it&rsquo;s also a lyric in a song. But what I really ended up liking about it was that in the making of this record, and as I said my journey over the past couple of years, has been a refinement for me in a lot of ways, but it was a grittier process. I had to come out of the other end as something else. So I guess those are kind of the two reasons.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>What was your inspiration in making the album?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>I think it was was my shadow side more so. I think everyone has a light and a dark, y&rsquo;know shadow side. Again painting, there&rsquo;s this thing called obscuro oscuro. It&rsquo;s that everything needs to have light and dark in order to have form. So, you can&rsquo;t tell a sphere is a sphere if you don&rsquo;t shadow it with light and dark. I&rsquo;ve always thought that that was really cool. Growing up in Wisconsin and going through Catholic school, I&rsquo;ve always been really careful to be really nice and really gentle, and kind of make sure I don&rsquo;t bother anybody, really stay on the straight and narrow. I think for a long time it kept me in a certain box and I wasn&rsquo;t really embracing my entire self. So for this record I wanted to be okay with accepting the darker sides of myself and not being so afraid to mess up, or be tough, and not worry about what everyone is going to think all the time. My first record was called <em>Hope and Heart</em>, which is a little bit of a lighter fare, that would be my light side, and I think this record represents my darker side a little bit.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>Do you feel like New York got you a bit more gritty? How did it feel going from the Midwest to New York for school?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>Yeah I think it definitely was a transition of having to have a thicker skin to get through the day because the energy in New York is so crazy, and honestly I&rsquo;ve been in Wisconsin this last week and I feel like I&rsquo;m on the best vacation ever. Just because it feels like you&rsquo;re getting these different wavelengths in New York. Even if you&rsquo;re in a quiet apartment for a second, it still feels like everybody is rushing. You have to keep up with that. The good thing about that is I think it really pushes you to stay ahead of the curve, and there&rsquo;s a lot of competition, healthy good competition. And in the music scene everyone is kind of trying to figure out how they can rise above the pack, so it definitely keeps you energized. I think that the music scene it&rsquo;s definitely based around playing gigs and getting certain venues. You kind of climb up the venue ladder, especially for the singer/songwriter scene. I think New York, a lot of it is paying your dues and just sticking around long enough to prove that you are really here to stay and you are here to really make a difference in the music scene. Eventually I think you get this sort of respect stamp. I think definitely being in New York has. There&rsquo;s this deli I go to, and I always buy a sandwich, and I swear the guy at the deli counter would always look me up and down and be like &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not from New York are you?&rdquo;  What is it? Do I have this huge sign on my head? Apparently I did, that said nice Midwestern girl or something.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>What do you miss about Milwaukee? How has Milwaukee shaped you as an artist?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>Milwaukee is such a beautiful place, and the Midwest in general. People are so nice here, and that is a beautiful thing. I think the values here are really amazing. The values that are instilled in young people coming out of the Midwest carry through your life in a really solid way. People always say the hardworking Midwesterners, getting the stuff done, and I think that&rsquo;s true. There&rsquo;s no complaining really, I mean we work hard, and then we come home to our families and we can live happy, or we try to live happy lives, and that may be a broad statement if you&rsquo;re generalizing an area of the country, but I think that sort of being in the bubble of the piece of Milwaukee Wisconsin, allowed me to grow up with a lot less pressure than maybe if I grew up in New York or LA. There was never this feeling growing up that I had to be a stage kid, or had to start auditioning for things when I was 12 because I could sing. My parents were just so great at just letting me grow up, and opportunities would come and we&rsquo;d take them, but it wasn&rsquo;t like this intense search for Star Search or anything. Although I did want to go on Showtime at the Apollo, which I did! But I loved being a part of We Are The Drum and the gospel choir was so incredible. I&rsquo;ve been trying to hold on to my Milwaukee roots as much as I can for the past eight years because I love being a part of the scene. The Milwaukee fan base and friends and family are so loyal and so supportive, and they always come out when I have shows here. Recently I have been getting more the Milwaukee music scene just cause there&rsquo;s so many good bands and stuff coming out of Wisconsin.</p>
      <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>In regards to journal entry you wrote about the discovery of the &ldquo;artistry of being an artist,&rdquo; how have you come to terms with that?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>I was so inspired by the Rodriguez Searching for Sugerman movie because here&rsquo;s this guy, his path was to not know of his success until he was 60 years old. He&rsquo;s working as a construction worker his whole life and little does he know he&rsquo;s as famous as Elvis in South Africa. That part of movie wasn&rsquo;t what inspired me the most, it was seeing his reaction to it. Just the fact that he kind of took that information that he was famous in this really like simple, beautiful way, like oh very cool, nice, well then I&rsquo;ll go perform over there. Cause if he had made it when he was younger, his path as an artist wouldn&rsquo;t have affected me in the same way. Now he&rsquo;s affected this entire generation of South African people during the apartheid with his music, and now because of the journey he had he&rsquo;s affecting this entire new generation of young artists who look at his life and think okay, I might not make it until I&rsquo;m 60 years old, but I just need to trust that my path is my path. Whether or not I get recognition doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m not good, or that my work isn&rsquo;t valid. It just means that maybe it&rsquo;s not the right time for it, and so I think that that is the artistry of being an artist. Accepting yourself and accepting your work, and accepting that what you do is what you&rsquo;re supposed to be doing, so that when you put things out there into the world it&rsquo;s a lot easier to just let it go and be okay with what it is.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">amfm: </strong>Did you have a moment when you realized that this is what you were supposed to be doing?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-d9bad36e-dde4-d583-bd53-c6cc1b506b0d">weber: </strong>I honestly have no memory of not wanting to be a singer. From the time I was three I was singing around the house. I remember in second grade being so positive that I was going to be a singer, but I think that I definitely questioned if this what really what I should do for my career. Can I make money off of this? Am I good enough? But there&rsquo;s always these little things that happen that keep me going. These little random things from the Universe that fall into my lap when I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;m about to give up that are like you should keep doing this, so I just keep listening to that and trusting that. The moment that I&rsquo;m unable to do anything with music is probably the time that I should stop, but until then opportunities keep opening up and it leads me to the next thing and the next thing. <br />
