      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Vic and Gab</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Vic and Gab have been singing together for practically their whole lives. From early beginnings belting Rush in the car with their father, to their first official band at the age of 16 as Carmello, where they made an entire album in Spanish. They have come a long way to where they are now, musically as well as geographically. They moved here from El Paso, when their father had to relocate for work, and it was in Milwaukee where their musical aspirations were cultivated. </p>      Their feel good indie rock got them noticed by MTV and their song &ldquo;So Long, So Tried,&rdquo; recorded on Garageband in their basement in 2011, landed them a track on the show <em>Skins</em>. Coming off the success of that, they decided to record an EP, <em>Bridges and Guns</em>, which is an a sad and much darker album disguised in happiness with their upbeat sound in songs like &ldquo;I Haven&rsquo;t Seen You,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Keep Walking.&rdquo;
      <p dir="ltr">      The sisters have definitely gotten comparisons to another sister duo with a similar sound, Tegan and Sara. Vic and Gab are currently playing gigs and working on the follow up album to their debut full length album <em>Love of Mine</em>, an album not about the perils of love, but about love itself in it&rsquo;s beautiful existence. <br />

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm:</strong> You guys have been full time musicians since you were 16, how did music influence you at such a young age, especially since neither of your parents were very musical? Was there ever any push back from them because you guys were so young?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic: </strong>We got the music bug from listening to bands my father played in the car. Gab and I would always sing along and as we got older I think we were intrigued by the composition and instrumentation of songs. My parents were always supportive, but there was a bit of hesitation when we told them we were going to do music full time. Parents always want the best for you so I guess they worry about us making a living. Haha. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>Was music something you always wanted to do? Have you and your sister always been musical? Did you guys do performances for your parents growing up or have a band?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic:</strong> I was really into playing soccer when I was in high school and college, so I strayed a little from music for about a year when I went to college even though I was convinced that I would end up making music with Gab. But Gab and I both knew that music was our calling and we had to do it! We would always perform for our relatives at parties and such, so singing in front of people is something we have been doing since I can remember. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>Your first official band was Carmello, which you recorded an album in spanish, but disbanded on a matter of artistic principle. what did you learn from that experience and how was your music back then different than what you&rsquo;re doing now? Does your old sound influence you guys now as Vic and Gab, and do you channel some of your latin roots in your music today?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic: </strong>We learned a lot when we were with Sony, like working under pressure and performing in front of big shots that just want to intimidate you. I think the performance of our songs was the same just the production was more extravagant that what it is now. I don't think our old stuff has any influence in what we do now. It's like looking at an old picture of yourself when you were 15 and saying &quot;I'm never going to wear that again - how embarrassing!&quot; But we definitely wouldn't be where we are now if it weren't for those 12 songs that we wrote when we were 16 years old. I feel like we don't have Latin roots in our music today or even when we were singing in Spanish. I think we naturally write indie-pop-rock and it sounds the same regardless of the language. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>When did you guys move to Milwaukee? (How old, and why?) What about Milwaukee did you like, and why did you think it would be a good place to start a music career as Vic and Gab?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic:</strong> We moved to Milwaukee in 2009 because of our dad's job. We first visited Milwaukee in 2008 to see Rush at Summerfest. When we were walking through the grounds Gab said to me &quot;We are going to play here one day!&quot; So we fell in love with Milwaukee and the idea of playing Summerfest. Milwaukee has been so generous with us and we are extremely thankful for all the love we receive. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>How does the music scene in Milwaukee differ from El Paso, where you&rsquo;re originally from? Do you guys have aspirations of going elsewhere?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic:</strong> I don't really know how the music scene is in El Paso. We were so young when we lived there that we didn't get to experience that. I know now that they are trying to expose the scene with a new festival they started called Neon Desert so hopefully that works out for them and we can play there someday. We have aspirations of going everywhere; we are really excited for 2014! <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>How did having &ldquo;So Long, So Tired&rdquo; a song you recorded acoustically in your basement on GarageBand before you were even officially a band help you gain momentum to form the band and try your hand at music again? What prompted you guys to make the song?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic: </strong>&quot;So Long, So Tired&quot; really motivated us to start the band. Having a song catch the ears of MTV music supervisors gave us an extra confidence boost. Gab and I were a little depressed, we had just moved to Milwaukee, we had no friends and were pretty much lonely. So we had a lot of time on our hands to focus on writing. We ending up writing a bunch of songs that ended up on our EP <em>Bridges and Guns</em>.<strong><br />
      </strong>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>How did you guys see yourselves evolve as a band and blossom in such a short amount of time? How did that feel? Six months in and you&rsquo;re touring, opening a rally for Obama, and you have a song on MTV.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic:</strong> It feels like a lot of things happened at the same time so we were just trying to get through it and do our best as we evolved and learned from those experiences. The momentum really helped us feel more confident on stage and fully believe in what we were doing. &nbsp;We have been so lucky and have had amazing opportunities like the Obama Rally and being featured on a couple of national magazines. </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>Do you guys get compared to sister duo Tegan and Sara often? Are they musical influences of yours? Who are some of your musical influence?
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic: </strong>We do - people even think we are twins! But we, Gab and I, are two years apart. I think it's good to be compared to Tegan and Sara. They are talented ladies and write great songs. I got into Tegan and Sara like four years ago so I can't really say they influenced me as much as bands like Rush, The Police, The Who, Death Cab among others. These are my true music gods!</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>What kind of transformation did you guys go through between the EP <em>Bridges and Guns</em>, which is described as a darker album in comparison to the light-hearted upbeat feel of your full length album <em>Love of Mine</em>? Why did you guys want to make an album about love? What is love in it&rsquo;s metamorphosis stage? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic: </strong>Our EP was dark because we were dealing with my cousins death. His sudden death really shocked us so everything we were writing was inevitably about him. That's why I like to think of our EP as a concept album. We transformed into a live band and got more and more comfortable with our drummer Jesus. We got the feel for what people like to hear at shows. People love to dance! So we said let's make some upbeat songs and let&rsquo;s write about love. Love in its metamorphosis stage? Metamorphosis is a process of transformation. Relationships are always changing and adapting to new situations. You're not the same as you were ten minutes ago. So we wanted to write about love and how it changes and challenges you everyday.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">amfm: </strong>What&rsquo;s next for you guys? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-2899f06c-3d8d-8aaf-badb-c5b4caba8e0b">vic: </strong>We have plans to tour some more in 2014! Release a couple of music videos and hopefully start laying down some new tracks for a new album or EP later this year. We can't wait to see what comes our way.      <br />
