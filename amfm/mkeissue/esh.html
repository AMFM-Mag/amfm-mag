      <p dir="ltr"><strong>Esh The Singer</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Lesha Sturdivant, more widely known as Esh, is a brown girl in a rock world. Besides standing out in a crowd with her bright red short pixie cut, her booming voice can capture and captivate a room. There was something about rock music that always spoke to her soul. Growing up she was influenced by great rock gods like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin and powerful women who pioneered the music scene like Tina Turner, Chaka Khan and Aretha Franklin. </p>      
      <p>The Chicago native, and American Idol contestant, made her way to Milwaukee and has made it her home since, performing back and forth between the two. In that time she has accomplished a lot as an artist since she released her EP &ldquo;You Should Know Me.&rdquo; She is currently working on a full length studio album and hitting the pavement with her full bad Red and Reckless. 
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Paving her own way against those who wanted her to conform to a musical style that didn&rsquo;t suit her, Esh is rebelling against perceived industry standards and exuding that anti-establishment, afro-punk demeanor by just opening her mouth and singing what&rsquo;s true to her musical heart. </p>      <strong>amfm:</strong> There aren't too many brown girls singing rock music these days. Why do you think so? What drew you to the genre? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>esh: </strong>The African-American culture is dictated by hip-hop and R&amp;B artists, even though we have deep roots in rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll as well. I don't think people are ready to openly accept and make room for black girls that authentically rock; however, there is a growing generation of underground black girls that sing rock music. &nbsp;It was the guitar riffs and straight-forward lyrics that drew me to the genre. It was a sound I had never heard before, but felt deeply connected to as a child growing up.</p>      <strong>amfm:</strong> Do you ever get any push-back or feedback on your music style? What was this like when you were first starting out? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>esh:</strong> Everyone is met with some resistance when trying to discover their purpose in life. I had a mix of both positive and negative feedback. When I first started to singing rock, my own insecurities, doubts and fears limited my growth. I wasn't connected to the right people who could guide and nurture my talents. </p>      <strong>amfm: </strong>You also used to sing backup for a country group, an afrobeat group, and started out with soul and R&amp;B. How has this range of music history made you into the artist that you are today? Was it necessary for you to experiment with all of these genres to come into your own? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>esh:</strong> It was very important for me to have a diverse background in music. Experiencing these different genres has helped mold me into the artist I am today. Gospel, Soul and R&amp;B were a huge influence while growing up. Afrobeat helped me with rhythm and timing and really built my stamina. Country music introduced me to a whole new culture of people and writing style.</p>      <strong>amfm:</strong> Who were your influences growing up? CDs you couldn't stop listening to? Who are some of them now? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>esh: </strong>While growing up I couldn't get enough of Anita Baker, Toni Braxton, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Kan, Tina Turner, Prince, Micheal Jackson, Millie Jackson, Luther Vandross, Mariah, and Whitney. The music I listen to now- it's more of my study, old and new age, enjoyment music-- The Rolling Stones, Beatles, Led Zepplin, Heart and No Doubt, Alanis Morissette, and Tori Amos. </p>      <strong>amfm: </strong>You started singing at an early age in church. How did your gospel background influence your music now? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>esh:</strong> I thank my Grandmother and the church choir for my lungs. Gospel music requires a big voice and the ability to sing. Some may even say scream (lol) for long periods of time. Some of the music I sing today requires me to belt out some pretty big notes. If not sung properly, your voice may not be ready for the next song. </p>
      <p><strong>amfm: </strong>You cited your grandmother as one of your biggest supporters. How did she inspire you to make music and find your voice?</p>
      <p><strong>esh: </strong>My grandmother, always pushed me to the limit. She did not play around when it came to singing. She was very strict and disciplined. She would always say &quot;If you want to sing, then sing for real, because I don't have time to play!&quot; Open your mouth, make me feel how much you love the Lord.&quot;  <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> Do you have a performance alter ego? Is Esh the Singer the same as Esh? </p>      
      <strong>esh: </strong>If you mean like Beyonce vs. Sasha Fierce....No! I wouldn't say I have a performance alter ego, I just really love what I do, and when I get on stage I want to always give my best to the fans. It's more of an inner passion than an ego taking over. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>You're back and forth between Chicago and Milwaukee. As a Chicago native, what made you come to Milwaukee, and why did you stay? </p>      <strong>esh: </strong>Milwaukee has always been a second home for me. I have &nbsp;family here as well. &nbsp;I remember coming back and forth for a summer to assist my dad. In between that time period I auditioned for American Idol, joined a afrobeat band called Tristan Royalty Squad, while singing back ground for Herman Astro. Everything was happening so fast, it only seemed fair to finish what I had started in Milwaukee. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm: </strong>How has Milwaukee benefited you as an musician? How do you see the scenes differ? How has Milwaukee become your home?</p>      
      <strong>esh:</strong> It doesn't matter what city you are in, you'll always find starving musicians working hard and waiting for their big break. I've learned, it's not about how good you are, it's how well you play the game. It was very easy for me to stand out in a new city, being a black girl, with red hair, singing rock music. I remember seeing my name for the first time in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, thanks to Gerald Blanks. After his article, raving reviews just kept coming. My mission had started, and I couldn't disappoint my new city. &nbsp; <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong>amfm:</strong> What&rsquo;s next for Esh? </p>      <p><strong>esh: </strong>So much has happened since the release of my EP &quot;You Should Know Me&quot; in 2012. A 2013 WAMI nominee for &quot;Female Vocalist of The Year,&quot; also a Featured Artist of The Month for WAMI, single debut performance on Fox 6 Wake-Up, Jazz In The Park, Summerfest 2013, Celebrity Interviewer for Harley Fest 110th Celebration, Fashion Week MKE Local Celebrity Icon Tribute to Esh, and the &quot;Newaukeean of the Week.&quot; The band has a very intense schedule planned for 2014. We're releasing new music, debuting a music video, and my team has worked extremely hard to build solid relationships this past summer. Playing Summerfest was definitely a highlight for me! I'm so looking forward to generating a greater fan base, playing on bigger stages, and booking more festivals in 2014. <br />
