        <p class="style4">amfm's 20 ALBUMS OF 2009 (6 thru 10)</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="style4">10. <strong>Jay- Z</strong>, The BluePrint 3</span></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/jayz.jpg" alt="jayz" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">J</span><span class="content">ay Z isn't retiring anytime soon,  especially when he's at the top of his game. <em>The  Blueprint 3</em> is Jay Z's eleventh album, and it is his  eleventh number one album in the United  States. Jay Z and Elvis Presley used to hold that title together when Jay only  had ten albums, but he has since taken  the throne from the King. The album was produced by the best of the best, Jay Z would settle for no less. Kanye  West, Timbaland, Swiss Beats,  The Neptunes, and more great names are behind the magic of <em>Blueprint 3. </em>This  album is the third in the <em>Blueprint</em> trilogy, and is by far some of Jay's best work, despite how commercial it is. As an older and wiser man gaining on 40,  Jay Z can still wow people with  his ability to make a hot track and even skip the beats, like he does on  &quot;Death of Auto-tune,&quot;  which is backed by horns, drums and guitars alludes to times without auto-tun. &quot;Death of the  ringtone/This ain’t for iTunes/This ain’t for sing-along/ This  is Sinatra at the opera, bring a  blonde,&quot; he raps in the track. Every track of the album has been a hit, &quot;Run This  Town,&quot; and &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; show how Jay Z is building himself a legacy, after all he  is the self proclaimed only rapper to re-write history,  and he has the credentials to back it up.</span></p>

          <p><span class="style4">9. <strong>SilverSun Pickups</strong>, Swoon </span></p>
          <p><img src="images/Albums/silversun.jpg" alt="silversun" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">T</span><span class="content">he band with the raspy voice that  fans fell in love with hearing &quot;Lazy Eye&quot; returns for their sophomore album, <em>Swoon</em>. The  Silversun Pickups's new album comes three years later than their debut release <em>Carnavas</em>. The album sort  of has a dual personality. While some  songs are intensely delicate and soft tones, others are in your face with a heightened energy. They have been  compared to the likes of The Smashing Pumpkins, which given the raspy voices, and distorted guitar  melodies, it is clear why that  connection  is often made. Swooning over the album is a given--there is definitely no   sophomore slump here. The Silversun Pickups have  moved on to having their songs  featured  in television shows and having high rotation on music channels like MTV and  VH1. <em>Swoon </em>bypassed <em>Carnavas </em>on  the charts, and found itself in the top ten for the Billboard charts. &quot;Growing Old is Getting Old&quot; is one  of those songs that speak to your  soul. &quot;So  we all are growing old/ Maybe we're sealed in silence/ And maybe we feel a guidance/ Maybe your own devices/ Will  keep you afraid and cold.&quot; The song starts off  slow and quiet, and builds becoming louder with the drums and the  guitar. <br />
          </span></p>

<p><span class="style4">8. <strong>Asteroids Galaxy Tour</strong>, Fruit  </span></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/asteroids.jpg" alt="asteroids" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">I</span><span class="content">f you don’t know who the Asteroids  Galaxy Tour is, take a second to think about all of  the awesome songs featured in iPod commercials and you will  surely find this one. The  Danish band’s  song “Around the Bend,&quot; from their debut album, <em>Fruit</em>, was featured in the popular iPod touch commercial displaying ‘The Funnest  iPod.’ The song is known for its horns, which the band expands to a six piece horn section, and the coked-out  voice of lead singer Mette Lindberg,  who has that certain Edie Sedgwick persona about her. The album, which is their debut, is the perfect thing to listen  to on a long drive, as all the songs meld perfectly  into one another. “Hero” is the type of song you put your hand out the window and move with the wind. Her  voice is melancholy yet powerful as the lyrics drag from her like the songstresses of the 60’s with a modern  electronic flair.  </span></p>
<p class="content">[AROUND THE BEND][HERO]</p>
<p><span class="style4">7. <strong>Mos Def</strong>, The Estatic </span></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/mosdef.jpg" alt="mosdef" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">D</span><span class="content">ef is most definitely a poet when it comes to  making music. Having not made an  album  since the critically acclaimed “Black on Both Sides,” Def pulls out all the  punches on his fourth studio album <em>The Estatic</em>. Featuring samples of all  genres and cultures—touching base  with Latin roots, Jazz, and funk, making this album a worldly addition to your album collection. Def sings most of the  song “No Hay Nada Mas” in Spanish. He also  has some stellar collaborations with Talib Kweli and Slick Rick. The Slick Rick collaboration “Auditorium” is  totally gangster. Def is a lyrical genius: &quot;Quiet storm vital  form  pen pushed it right across/Mind is a vital force, high level right across/Shoulders  the lions raw voice is the siren&quot;  as he raps in the song. </span></p>

<p><span class="style4">6. <strong>Passion Pit</strong>, Manners</span></p>
<p><img src="images/Albums/passionpit.jpg" alt="passionpit" width="200" height="200" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" /><span class="style4">P</span><span class="content">assion Pit exploded onto the scene  this year, and was described as one of the best live   performances of Lollapalooza. The Massachusetts based band  originally formed to  create a compilation  of songs for Michael Angelakos to write for his girlfriend. Good thing he had that girlfriend to write songs  for because it resulted in the band evolving into  something more substantial. Sleepyhead, one of the most recognized songs from their album <em>Manners</em> has that electro-vibe that takes over your body and makes  it want  to move. It has an ethereal  quality with the breathy vocals, especially the video for the single, which features a spinning box  with Angelako’s face going around and around, kind  of like the song in your head. Other standout tracks include “Moth’s Wings” and  “The Reeling.” “Moth’s Wings” is  hopeful. It sounds like you should be dancing on clouds,  representing the epitome of seizing the day. The pacing, piano, and Angelako’s voice and trippy effect make you feel like  you’re in a magical Passion Pit fantasy world. It’s  easily one of the best of the album. Seize the day when you listen to this  song.   </span></p>
