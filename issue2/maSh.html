        <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/maSh/kelsey2.jpg" alt="kelseywitte" width="363" height="237" hspace="5" align="left" />F</span>or Chicago designer, Kelsey Witte, leggings were just a fashionable and comfortable clothing option she designed to wear to get around New York City on her bike. Never did she imagine that she would be selling a young New York lifestyle. </p>
        <p>“I wanted to wear something that would be comfortable and fashionable–something I could bike around in, [and] go to yoga, but also get me noticed when I went out,” says Witte. “Everyone who saw the leggings liked them and asked for a pair, so I started to concentrate more on that to see where it would take me.” <img src="../images/issue 2/maSh/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="268" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p>Boy did they get her noticed. Two years later, and we have maSh.The vibrant and crazy patterns reflect the city in which they were born. A Parsons student at the time, Witte was living in the Nolita/Bowery neighborhood of New York City. Making the leggings started off as  an after school project for her. </p>
        <p>“In New York I was surrounded by creative people who were always up for collaborating,” says Witte. “I produced a look book for the line using my apartment rooftop and roommate as a model, styled with our own shoes. Another friend did the cover art.”</p>
        <p>She made roughly 20 copies of the lookbook and sent them to magazines with handwritten notes to the marketing and features editors, and emailed a couple of blogs. Her trendsetting friends’ approval and their being photographed in her leggings was just added exposure. Pretty soon all that leg work paid off. The <em>Urban Outfitters blog</em> and <em>NYLON Magazine</em> picked up on her trendy leggings, and featured maSh on their web sites. <img src="../images/issue 2/maSh/mash5.jpg" alt="mash" width="380" height="244" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/maSh/mash3.jpg" alt="mash" width="255" height="388" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Witte describes herself as shy, but you wouldn’t believe that by looking at her leggings. The name maSh to Witte means “a mash-up mix,” probably of M.I.A., who Witte lists as an inspiration for her leggings. For her, the leggings were a way of expressing herself without speaking, something which she has valued deeply growing up, and was instilled with at the schools she’s gone to.</p>
        <p>Her inspiration is a mash up of things as well; “gang gang dance, salsa clubs in Harlem, visiting bands from Mexico City, Russian cigarettes, circus parades along the Mississippi River, disco punk shows in Brooklyn backyards, installation art from Iceland, and modern German paintings,” which she describes on her web site. </p>
        <p>Having left Parsons after a year, and no longer having the support of scholarships and family, Witte found herself in a mix of odd jobs to keep herself afloat in the concrete jungle, and it spilled out into her busy and eccentric designs. “I was getting by with a collection of ridiculous jobs,” says Witte. “I was waitressing, working at a music venue, go-go dancing, working as a film extra, a mystery shopper, a line sitter...” Her leggings were her second skin. <img src="../images/issue 2/maSh/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="332" height="90" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
<p>Witte reminisces about when leggings resurfaced in 2006 and were just simple monochromic designs. Now leggings come in all colors, patterns, cut-outs, fabrics and designs. There’s leather and lace, denim, zippers and studs. They can add spice to any simple and neutral outfit, and make you feel like a super woman with all the stuff you’re getting done while looking hip and comfortable. <img src="../images/issue 2/maSh/mash2.jpg" alt="mash" width="322" height="196" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></p>
        <p>“You can do anything in these leggings,” says Witte. “Girls could wear maSh to yoga in the morning, paired with flats and a loose top in the afternoon. In the evening they could be worn under boots to a show, or with heels and a leather jacket to go dancing.” </p>
        <p>Witte has since relocated to Chicago to finish school at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago [SAIC], where there are a lot of programs to help young fashion designers financially. There she has been able to concentrate on designing and branding the line. She still goes to New York to buy her fabrics, get a taste of the city, and give thanks for a dream she never thought she’d have. So much for the girl who didn’t plan on becoming a designer.</p>
