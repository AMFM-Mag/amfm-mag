      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4"><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/kimart1.jpg" alt="art" width="619" height="354" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="right" /></strong>Kim Loper</span> self describes herself on her blog as a “Twenty something year old graduate with a heart existing somewhere between the Midwest, Brazil, and places she’s never been.” She is consumed by “art, language, beats, ladies, books, cynicism, fashion and food.” All of this is reflected on her canvas. Inspired by the bare minimum of our true selves, Loper is fascinated with the human figure and mind, metaphorically and physically. Her work exposes the beauty of the body, culture, sexuality, and emotions that sometimes can’t be expressed through written word or speech, but with reflection through paint.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did you know you wanted to be an artist?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Loper:</strong> I've always done art. I've gone to art schools for as long as I can remember. I double majored in Art in college. I like art; I like to do art, talk about art, and look at art. But I vehemently rejected calling myself an artist. I thought to call yourself an artist meant something more accomplished than what I considered myself. It was just this past year that I really fell in love with my own art, and that was I guess when I knew I wanted to be an artist. When I realized it wasn't about accomplishing anything. It's just about doing shit.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What is your preferred medium? <strong><span class="style4"><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="252" height="224" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="right" /></strong></span></strong></p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> Oil and acrylic paint on wood and canvas. I got into woodcut relief printing a little my last semester and fell in love, but I don't have a printing press or anything so I don't know if I'm allowed to call that my preferred medium.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What types of subject matters do you like painting?</p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> I like to do abstract bullshit above-the-couch paintings, because it makes me feel good to just do it, but I think it's more about what I <em>have</em> to paint. I prefer to paint concepts; I paint my thoughts. I don't know if it's through art that I can explore certain obsessions, or if my art practice has forced me to obsess over certain things. But, I like food, and sex, and women, and violence, and race theory, and humor, so that’s what I have to paint about. </p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/kimart3.jpg" alt="art" width="276" height="360" hspace="5" align="left" />amfm: </strong>Who are your artist inspirations? </p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> I'm inspired by peers, teachers, and mentors making art. I love love love Kara Walker, Egon Schiele, Wangechi Mutu,and Louis Bourgesie. Mostly women artists exploring race or sexuality, but I'm equally inspired by activists, writers, film makers, friends, and musicians that help take some of the concepts I work with into a different perspective. Like, I'll watch a really intense, brilliant film, and I'll connect with it in whatever way. I'll have crazy dreams about it, write about that dream, and my connection to the thought, then try to find some way to push it out even further, turn it into art. I find inspiration in everyone.</p>
<p><strong>amfm: </strong>What inspires you as an artist?</p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> I'm mostly inspired by my own experiences and enthusiasms. Recently I've been interested in distinguishing the difference between obsession and interest. There are certain things I find myself being inspired by influences that subconsciously creep into my work,  African art, feminist art, and street art. </p>
        <p>What I'm interested in now is what it means for an artist to be &quot;inspired&quot; by something  outside of their own histories or experience. There's a potency of cultural obsessions or fetishes that white people have with art made by people of color, so I try and figure out what my place in these hierarchies is. Am I attracted to a certain thing because it's just what I like, or is it becauseI've created an obsession for it?<strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/kimart6.jpg" alt="art" width="368" height="283" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></strong><br />
        </p>
<p><strong>amfm:</strong> What are your favorite types of pieces to do, the abstract or realist figures? How do they speak to you differently?</p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> Well I've done some paintings that were completely aesthetic and nothing more. Their purposes were either cathartic, practice, or commission, and those are the ones that I don't really have much to say about. The focus is on color and composition, which are important areas to strengthen, but don't really mean anything. They're just fillers. I've done some situational abstract pieces that represent a space, a relationship, or an event that happened in my life. Those are fun to work through. </p>
        <p>I really love people. I'm not a super outgoing conversationalist, but I love watching and listening to people and their stories. That’s what I feel the most connected to, characters and what they have to say about the world.</p>
