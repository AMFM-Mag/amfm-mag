        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <p><span class="style4">T</span>he DJ is not only the life of the party, the DJ makes the party. The DJ controls the vibe in the room, and sets the mood for the night at the flip of a switch. At the kick of a disc, the DJ takes music risks. Lil' Wayne knew what he was talking about when he made &quot;Go DJ.&quot; Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton knew what they were talking about when they wrote the book &quot;Last Night a DJ Saved My Life.&quot;</p>
        <p>amfm is honoring the DJ, and profiling four of our favorite DJ's, Clockwork, OCD Automatic, DJ Fortune, and DJ Charlie Hustle. <br />

            spinning from LA/BOSTON/NYC</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did you get into DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>CLOCKWORK: </strong>I've always been into hip-hop, and I remember in high school I started watching turntablism videos. That summer me and two friends took lessons at this local record shop to learn the basics of scratching and mixing. I just kept going with it and eventually got into the whole electronic dance movement that's been huge in my hometown of Los Angeles. I wanted to be able to spin my own tracks so I borrowed a copy of Reason from a friend, and have been using it ever since. I feel fortunate that I started when I did and how I did, because I think learning to mix on real vinyl is essential for any good DJ.<strong><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/clockwork.jpg" alt="clockwork" width="533" height="353" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></span></strong></p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How long have you been DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK: </strong>Almost three years</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What kind of music do you spin?</p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK:</strong> Any sub genre of dance music, it really depends on the gig and venue</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Why do you think LA was the stimulus for the electronic music movement? What do you love about electronic?</p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK:</strong> Los Angeles is the mecca for the thuggest rap, to the cheesiest of pop, and basically everything in between. I think what has pushed the whole electronic movement so hard in Los Angeles is the fact that mainstream club music is now combining elements of both the feel of rap lyrics and the energy of dance tracks. Instead of sticking to old school samples and a grittier production style, rappers are now taking classic dance tracks and rapping over them (i.e. &quot;Say Yeah&quot;- Wiz Khalifa or &quot;Krazy&quot;- Pitbull), which has blurred the line between mainstream rap and electronic music. </p>
          <p>Also, LA is notoriously a club city. There is a natural inclination for heavy dance tracks that will do well in clubs. For people that are trying to get their music out there and heard by the public, creating music that will be played at clubs and parties seems to be a viable option right now. LA is a city that likes to be ahead of the game, it's very diverse, wealthy, and over and above all, creative.</p>
          <p><strong>
          amfm:</strong> Why did you feel particularly drawn to hip hop growing up? </p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK: </strong>I think hip-hop was something that I had never fully embraced until I started watching people cutting and scratching old hip hop loops and samples and started seeing it in a different light. From there, I began picking up all the classics I could find at the time. I still remember when I first got A Tribe Called Quest's Low End Theory back in like 9th grade and I listened to it on loop for probably 6 months. Hip Hop has and always will be an influence for me.</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/clockworkpullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="269" hspace="5" align="left" />amfm: </strong>Why do you think learning with vinyl is essential for a good DJ?</p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK: </strong>I think that learning on vinyl is essential because it's all about having an ear for music, especially when it comes to mixing on vinyl. Nowadays the standard for DJs are programs like Scratch Live or Traktor, which are completely visual programs. Having learned how to mix songs using just my ear and familiarize myself with the feel of vinyl, it has been, and will be easier for me to adapt to the ever-changing technological advances in the world of DJing. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What has been your favorite place to perform?</p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK:</strong> The spots I've played in New York like the Ella in East Village, have been a really good time and were some of my first gigs so I will always have an affinity with that area.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> If you had to listen to one song on repeat for the rest of your life, what song would that be? Which song would you absolutely NOT want to hear?</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/reason.jpg" alt="reason" width="237" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />CLWRK:</strong> Song on repeat for the rest of my life, Say Aah by Trey Songz featuring Fabolous, Song I would absolutely NOT want to hear, Clockwork by Juelz Santana</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What is your favorite thing about DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>CLWRK:</strong> The fact that I'm essentially sharing what music I like to other people and having them react positively.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Do you like DJing or producing more? Why? </p>
          <p><strong>
            CLWRK:</strong> Both have their perks, but I think right now I'm enjoying producing more. <br />
            I love being able to do what I want, send out the finished product, and see and hear people's reaction.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>
          amfm:</strong> What made you think to mix Lil’ Wayne with The Office theme of all things? Are you an Office fan?</p>
          <p><strong>
          CLWRK:</strong> It really just started when I was watching an episode in my dorm room. The theme song came on and I thought it would be a cool idea to sample it, so during the episode, I downloaded the theme music, chopped it up, and found an acapella that matched well over it which happened to be Lil' Wayne's &quot;Hustler Musik&quot; and I finished it by the end of the episode. I just sent it to a few friends and held onto it for probably three months before sending it to a couple blogs. The response has been crazy. Nevertheless, I am a huge Office fan.</p>
