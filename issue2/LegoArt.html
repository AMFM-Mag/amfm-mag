      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br />
          <span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/sawayapullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="232" height="266" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />T</span>he difference between the way you and I play with LEGOs, and the way Nathan Sawaya and David Tracy play with LEGOs is that they aren’t really playing. Back when LEGO was created in 1940 in Billund Denmark, neither of these two LEGO brick artists were born, but they would both be a part of the building blocks of the LEGO art movement.<br />
        </p>
        <p>LEGO in itself is a movement. There have been small cities designed, numerous books and films made, and theme parks constructed in honor of the plastic bricks. LEGOs are the ultimate toy, not only are you playing, you’re creating. <br />
        </p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/gray.jpg" alt="gray" width="262" height="385" hspace="10" align="left" />When nationally recognized LEGO brick artist, Nathan Sawaya, decided to trade in his law books for LEGO bricks, it was the best decision he ever made. Not because he gets to build things out of LEGOs for a living, but because he finally gets to do what he’s passionate about, art. <br />
        </p>
        <p>“I used to be a corporate lawyer in New York City.  After a long day at the law firm, I would come home and need to create something,” Sawaya says. “It was almost therapeutic for me. To come home and create was therapy for my mind.”<br />
        </p>
<p>Sawaya has been “fooling around with sculpture” his whole life using more traditional methods in the past like clay and wire. He likes to create a challenge for himself and create that wow factor, so he’s worked with more innovative sculpting mediums like bottle caps, candy, and chocolate. <img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/green.jpg" alt="green" width="184" height="463" align="right" /></p>
        <p>He decided to build on that essence of building with unconventional things and thought back to his childhood love for the toy. The first lego sculpture he decided to make was a self portrait  that took him three months to create. That was as long as it took for him and family and friends to realize that he was on to something. <br />
        </p>
<p>“I use LEGO bricks as a medium because I enjoy seeing people’s reactions to artwork created from something with which they are familiar,” Sawaya explains. “Everyone can relate to it since it is a toy that many children have at home. I want to elevate this simple plaything to a place it has never been before.”</p>
<p>Sawaya is taking LEGO where it’s never been before. In museums and galleries around the nation and world, on Extreme Makeover Home Edition, The Colbert Report, and MythBusters. His LEGO art exhibit in New York was the first ever solo gallery show dedicated strictly to LEGO art. </p>
        <p>“Other than my website, a lot of my exposure has just been word of mouth,” Sawaya explains. “People enjoyed the human forms that I was creating out of LEGO bricks, and they just seemed to spread the word.  Eventually I was asked to put together an entire solo exhibition of my work, and it drew huge crowds.</p>
        <p>And it created a huge buzz. His lego art is such advanced play, that one cannot even fathom how he is able to create the curves and intricate details of his plastic brick masterpieces. Some of his most impressive pieces are those life size human figures. <img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/Yellow3.jpg" alt="yellow" width="243" height="206" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></p>
        <p>Life size sculptures like Blue, Green, Yellow, Hands, and Grasp bring the legos to life. In Yellow thousands of golden yellow LEGOs are constructed into a man literally ripping himself open. In Grasp, the legos form the figure of a man  being pulled back by arms, which Sawaya says represents all those people who told him “no and you can’t do that.” </p>
        <p>“The sculptures Yellow, Blue and Green all have to do with transitions,” he explains. “In each sculpture, a human form is not complete and is in the process of either putting themselves together or destroying themselves. I was going through my own metamorphoses at the time I was creating these pieces and I think that comes through in the artwork.”<img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/grasp.jpg" alt="grasp" width="205" height="331" align="right" /></p>
        <p><br />
        Most of them are so emotionally charging, it’s amazing that LEGO could convey such expression. The expression is all within the limits of the artist. Sawaya says it starts with an idea, and from there it builds, first in his mind, then on paper, and then in actual construction. </p>
        <p>“Working with LEGO bricks can be confining because I am working with small rectangles,” he says. “Fluid curves are the biggest challenge, but also the most awe-inspiring when they are completed.” </p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/legoart/Iwojima.jpg" alt="iwojima" width="230" height="282" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Awe-inspiring like Sawaya’s LEGO replica of the Battle of Iwo Jima bronze statue, which is permanently on display in the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Virginia. Or like the 20 foot long Tyrannosaurus Rex sculpture composed of over 80,000 LEGO bricks. </p>
<p>“I also did a billboard that hung up in Hollywood a few years ago. It measured over 53 feet long and 15 feet high. I used over 500,000 individuals pieces of LEGO to create it,” he said.</p>
        <p>Now that’s a lot of bricks, and LEGO bricks aren’t exactly easy to come by these days either. In the last decade, LEGO has begun selling LEGO themed toy sets like Star Wars, rather than the individual building bricks. </p>
        <p>Sawaya orders his wholesale through a private affiliate, and collects and reuses used bricks people discard. His color coded studio in New York, which he describes on his web site as “like walking into a rainbow” houses over 1.5 million LEGO pieces. </p>
        <p>The more LEGOs, the more possibilities. Sawaya laughs when asked how it feels to have started a LEGO art movement. “I am happy to be a part of the LEGO art movement, but the movement started over 50 years ago when the first two LEGO bricks were snapped together,” he says. “I have had a fun adventure taking LEGO bricks in a new direction and that’s into the fine art gallery. Everyday I am contacted by someone who tells me they are going to do what I do and create art out of LEGO.”</p>
