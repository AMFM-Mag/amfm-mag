    <td><p class="style4">Q&amp;A WITH 410 BC</p>
      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4"><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/410lookbook1.jpg" alt="nicole" width="577" height="384" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />4</strong>10 BC </span>is more than just the restoration of democracy for Athens. It means fighting for what you believe in, coming together, and standing up for the common good. That’s what founders Nicole Giambolvo and Rachel Goodman-Imhoff were inspired by when naming their independently owned clothing, skateboard and lifestyle brand, 410 BC.</p>
        <p>The two began making screen printed tee shirts at their Massachusetts college because they were passionate about making their own clothing. Since the presence of ethically fashionable clothing options were lacking on their campus, they filled that void themselves. Pretty soon their friends caught on and wanted in on the goods, and the demand became so high the two became practicing entrepreneurs behind the doors of their dorm room. </p>
        <p>Now a collective of young artists and designers, 410 BC has become a trendsetting and cutting edge company that works together to fight the laws of fashion. With ethical and fashionable roots on their side, they will fight the good fight. 410 BC isn’t going anywhere any time soon, they are expanding everyday.</p>
        <p class="style4">amfm had the opportunity to talk with co-founder of 410 BC, Nicole, about Athens, subcultures, and the 410 BC lifestyle and message.</p>
<p><strong>amfm:</strong> How has the business evolved since the days of operating out of the dorm room? <span class="style4"><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="249" height="220" hspace="5" align="right" /></strong></span></p>
        <p><strong>410 BC:</strong> Well, we don’t operate out of a dorm room anymore, haha! We’ve expanded to producing a lot of other products. We use better printing techniques, we went into cut and sew. We’ve also been carried by more stores and we are able to have more people work with us.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How was it for you to have started a business so young? What have you guys learned over the years?</p>
<p><strong>410 BC:</strong> In some ways it was a good thing, we got to learn a lot at a young age. In other ways it was not so good because we did not have any experience and were sometimes naïve. We got taken advantage of a lot of times. The number one thing I’ve learned is how to not get taken advantage of and how to spot when someone is trying to rip you off. Sadly, there are a lot of people in the apparel industry who want to take advantage of young brands.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How did your beginnings influence how you guys operate business now?</p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/pic1.jpg" alt="410bc" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="left" />410 BC: </strong>We come from very humble beginnings. Literally, just making everything by hand in a room at college, then moving on to working with other friends in a simple, DIY way. I think that has carried over to the way we operate business now in that we are very personable with our customers. I have customers who send me birthday cards and presents, customers who text me, customers I’ve met up with and become friends with. We’re still a humble business.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did 410 BC get it's big break and start gaining momentum in the public eye?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC:</strong> That took a long time. There were some big things that got us out there though. We were featured in <em>Bust Magazine</em> twice and once in <em>Nylon Magazine</em>, then <em>We Are The Market </em>did an article on us and we got posted on Brad Walsh's <em>Junk Magazine</em>. From there we just kept getting more press in various magazines and blogs that got the word out about our company. We had a lot of help from friends who supported what we were doing. </p>
        <p>We kept sending our products to magazines and blogs to get featured. Then we started contacting bands. A friend of ours got M.I.A. to wear a tee and then Tegan and Sara bought some of our shirts at a store called Unite in Northampton, Massachusetts and wore our tees to a bunch of shows when they were on tour. After all that 410 <img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/pic4.jpg" alt="410bc" width="229" height="343" align="right" />BC just took off. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> In what ways do you draw an influence from subcultures like skateboarding, punk, hip-hop, indie and DIY?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC: </strong>Mainly, we just work with artists who come from those various subcultures. Most of the people who work for 410 BC grew up involved in a subculture like the ones mentioned. In regard to DIY, we began as a completely DIY brand, hand printing all our tees in a dorm room. We’re still definitely an “indie” brand in that we’re independently owned. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Why do you think music, art and fashion go hand in hand? How has 410 BC melded these things together?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC: </strong>They all involve creativity. Also, fashion and music fall under the category of the arts. In terms of how we’ve used these things, all of our designs are made and then printed onto a tee shirt, which is essentially art becoming fashion. Music comes into play because we sponsor a lot of bands who wear our products and try to support the music industry in that way as we have a deep appreciation for music. </p>
