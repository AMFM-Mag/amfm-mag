      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br />
        <span class="style4"><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/byrdartist.jpg" alt="byrdman" width="502" height="333" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></strong>W</span>hen you see a painting or portrait by <span class="style4">Matthew David Byrd </span>you know it’s his. He’s got a signature style combining elements of paint with steel and metal work that bring his pieces to life. Whether it’s hair coming off of the canvas or metal birds extended from the top, there is some of Byrd in everything he does. </p>
        <p>What you might not have known is that he designed that crazy red bench you sit on in front of Ink Drinks and Eats, or that he makes gigantic kitchen utensils like the wisk inside of downtown Sac’s restaurant House, or that he is a bartender and mermaid at Dive Bar in his free time. </p>
        <p>He’s constantly pushing the boundaries and himself, trying to do things on a grandeur scheme. That’s why he chose to work with metal, that’s why he doesn’t box himself in with one preferred medium, and that’s why he’s our artist of the issue.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did you get into metal work/welding?</p>
        <p><strong>MATTHEW DAVID BYRD:</strong> Well as a kid I would make these little wire mixed media figures and mini sculptures. As I grew so did they and finally they reached a point when realized that I didn't have the know how or equipment to follow through with the images in my head. I enrolled in a few metal welding and jewelry making courses at Sac City College and after that have been pretty much self taught.</p>
<p><strong>amfm:</strong> What kinds of mini sculptures were you making when you were little? did you always have an artistic side?<strong><img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote1" width="300" height="92" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /></strong></p>
        <p><strong>BYRD: </strong>The mini's were usually weird contraptions like things that you could wind up with a rubber band to make them bounce around all crazy or spring into the air. Some times they were accessories for my action figures: robot arms, body armor, vehicles, hats. What ever they need to have so I could continue with my action figure sagas. So times I would make whole action figures out of paper clips and Popsicle sticks.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> When did you decide to fuse paint with metal? How did you find that bridge to bring them together? Did you go into it initially planning on combining the two did it just happen?<img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/byrdbirds.jpg" alt="birds" width="382" height="287" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> Like most things I do, it just sort of happened. Color is my life force, so having one with out the other just wouldn't work for me. Isometimes use the metals themselves to get the colors I'm looking for, but usually paint is just a much more exciting option.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did growing up around your grandmother influence your work?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD: </strong>When you walked into my Gram's house the first thing you would see was an easel with what ever she was working on at the time, another easel with a portrait she did of Jesus, probably another easel with a painting of Diana Ross, and a room full of furniture behind them all that we weren't really allowed to sit on. Walking into her house definitely left an impression onme as a person and an artist.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Do you remember that pivotal piece you made when you were seven that you spoke about in your bio?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> I remember everything about that piece. I don't have an amazingly detailed recall of memories, but that day stuck. I was at my babysitter’s house sitting at her kitchen counter. She had a nephew a few years older than me named Tommy and he was a really great comic style artist and I thought he was the business so I would try and try to draw like him. That day he was over and it made my want to get out the art supplies and everything just started to click.[It was the] first thing I drew that didn't get away from me. Tommy went on to create characters for DC comics, but I got tired of drawing super heroes by about middle school.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How did your art education help push your work to evolve?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> My &quot;Art Education&quot; didn't really start until my senior year of high school. I had a great teacher that year that pushed me to consider a future as an artist. Before that I hadn't taken my talents seriously. After I graduated I was accepted into a summer art program being held at CalArts in Valencia, CA. The experience gave me direction, which wasn't something I'd never known before. As far as the actual &quot;education&quot; goes, I have felt a bit let down over the years with a lot of my art classes and find that life has been a much better teacher for me.<strong><img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/byrdhair.jpg" alt="byrdhair" width="505" height="337" vspace="5" align="right" /></strong></p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How has Sacramento influenced you as an artist? Do you plan to stay in Sacramento?</p>
        <p><strong>BYRD:</strong> Sacramento has been the life, death, and resurrection of my creativity. In the 80's and early 90's Oak Park and South Area weren't exactly the kind of places where being an artist was even talked about. I didn't even consider the thought of having a career as a creative person until college. Life in Sac can get very heavy sometimes and working in warehouses and bussing tables can definitely take some of the excitement out of coming home and doing more work, art or otherwise. </p>
        <p>I will say that if your eyes are open and you're willing to experience life and people completely, Sacramento is a great pace. Its been my family and wonderful friends that have given me the drive and opportunities to keep creating. I don't know how long I'll be here but I will always be a dirty Sactown kid.</p>
