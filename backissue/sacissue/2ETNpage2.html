      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How did you get started designing jewelry? How did you market yourself in the beginning? When did you start gaining exposure?  </p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> Pam began designing jewelry while in college in San Francisco working for an amazing design duo: Navarro Alternatives. This husband and wife team worked similarly to how we work today. I was lucky enough to be their daughter’s friend at the time and they brought me in to create and design for them. They were true pioneers in the world of one-of-a-kind jewelry design incorporating found objects. They also did this amazing job of hiring family and friends, so it was an amazing environment to be in.<strong><img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/cuffs.jpg" alt="cuffs" width="545" height="204" align="left" /></strong></p>
        <p>This is exactly the environment that we try to create at 2ETN. In 2005 I started a line on my own called Pamela Tuohy Jewelry that used photocopied imagery from the public domain. Little by little I began to see this type of work everywhere, especially using found vintage items. The concept has gotten so trendy that now “Vintage-like” jewelry is being created by just about everyone and most manufactured in China. I couldn’t compete with that nor did I want to. </p>
        <p>My reaction to that was to begin finding rare vintage pieces and designing my own “frames” in Sterling and asked Ed if he would create the imagery inside of these pieces. I was a bit nervous when I first asked Ed to create imagery for the jewelry as he usually works in large format and has been selling his work for many years, but luckily he has immense respect for the miniature artists and the work that was created pre-photography, so 2ETN was established in 2008.<br />
           <br />
          <strong><img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote2" width="276" height="300" align="right" />amfm: </strong>how has your work evolved over time?</p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> We had an amazing PR group out of NYC in the beginning and they helped us get most of our press. However, when our work transformed in to only one-of-a-kind work, we did not see the need for that type of exposure, as we could not create the quantities that are demanded by that type of outreach.</p>
        <p>What has been refreshing for us is that by word of mouth and by the wonderful blogs that have been written lately we receive a significant amount of press and we are so very grateful for that. It is actually perfect for us. The clients we have presently have a deep understanding of what we do and are not driven by what is trendy, but by what is made well and by what every one else does NOT have!</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>what kind of person are you designing for? who wears your jewelry?<br />
           <br />
          <strong>2ETN:</strong> We design for the person who wants something that no one else has. For the person who respects story telling. Our hope is that 2ETN tells these stories—weighted with meaning, expressions of joy, beauty, bereavement, joinings, separations, bonds, friendship, love, power, respect, healing, sentiment, and birth. We believe that those stories should be told authentically and with care in a personal and in a “quiet” non-exploitative , non-trendy fashion.<img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/spider.jpg" alt="spider" width="157" height="208" align="right" /><br />
        </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> why birds, bugs and skulls? </p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> Bugs and spiders mainly because I had a phobia of these precious creatures and by wearing imagery of them, those phobias are gone. Some of our other clients have had the same reaction! [It’s] really exciting for us when someone who has had a fear of a certain creature, buys one of pieces and gets over it! </p>
        <p>Birds, well, we just love birds, especially birds of prey. We have hawks that visit our yard and I suppose it is the beauty in the cycle of life. Skulls are particularly interesting to us  because of profound respect for death, and for he fact that death seems so taboo in our culture and we believe there is beauty in it.  </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> what is the weirdest thing you’ve been inspired by? </p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/deer.jpg" alt="deer" width="175" height="172" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />2ETN:</strong> Haven’t found that as of yet..nothing has really been weird or off limits…however, we don’t do kitty cats, dogs, or clowns.<br />
           <br />
        <strong>amfm:</strong> where do you find the recycled pieces that you work with? how do you know when a specific piece is “the one”?</p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> Finding pieces usually on the road at antique fairs. We especially like purchasing special pieces from an owner with a story about the piece. If we find something one-bay, we make sure that we connect with the owner. It is important to us that it comes from a place with a story attached. Therefore, it is “the one” if it has a story, has a space to create an image in, or if a client has a piece that they would like to see recreated in to a 2ETN work.<img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/owl.jpg" alt="owl" width="141" height="184" align="right" /></p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>how has sacramento influenced your career and embraced you as a designer? </p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> Sacramento has allowed us to afford to live and work as artists. It is the perfect environment to create in for us. Near to an airport, 1.5 hours away from San Francisco and the mountains. We can grow our own food here. Living on a flat grid lets us ride our bikes often. We love the farmers markets and the little bars and restaurants that are springing up all over midtown. The tree coverage is especially encouraging. </p>
        <p>Lately, we have seen an influx of artists to this community for the same reasons I believe. Local media has been really good to us, and yet, we do not have many clients in this area at all. Our clients are mostly in Dallas, NYC, LA, Chicago, San Francisco &amp; Seattle. We even have a few in England and Italy.</p>
