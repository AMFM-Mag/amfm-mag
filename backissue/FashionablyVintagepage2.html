        <p class="content">The Good Style Shop’s in store shows   are intimately jam-packed into their little space. Condensation fogs   the windows, people spill out into the sidewalk to smoke cigarettes   and chat. They have art shows on a regular basis, and try to bring in   underground music that people may not know about. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/goodstylesidewalk.jpg" alt="goodstyle" width="290" height="192" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
<p class="content">“I think we've been able to get some   interesting bands who might have skipped over Madison,: explains Dunis.   “Maybe they would’ve played a bigger club, but it wouldn’t have   been as intimate and free to create that sense of community,” she   says. </p>
        <p class="content">“You can see a band play while you   shop. To be able to see a band who will play to 700 people in like New   York or something, you get to see them here, in an intimate setting,”   adds Coyes. He says if someone wants to do a show at their store, all   they have to do is express an interest in doing so and be serious about   it.</p>
        <p class="content">The shows definitely brought people   into the store initially. Dunis and Coyes say that they were surprised   at the turnout they saw in their first few months they were open. Despite   not having  much advertising, both agree that the people just kind   of found them, and news traveled by word of mouth. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/aaronandindra.jpg" alt="aaronandindra" width="408" height="291" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">“I think people were looking for   some vintage. I think also the difference with our store is that we do   carry some new items,” Dunis says. </p>
        <p class="content">They’ve also adopted the west coast’s   “buy-sell-trade” concept, where people can sell their clothing and   items to the store in return for store credit, or they can trade something   they already have for something new. Their store is a place where people   that don’t have a lot of money can come in and trade something. Artists   of any kind can display a tape, record, or jewelry and they’ll sell   it. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="197" height="116" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">Quality is everything when it comes   to sifting through items that people bring in, or when seeking out new   digs. They try to pay attention to what’s trendy at the moment, and   what’s prevalent at stores like Urban Outfitters and styles in fashion   magazines. Dunis feels that being aware of those things is important   because that’s what the people want. They do most of their buying   and shopping out of state where they say they’ve found some “pretty   cool stuff.”</p>
        <p class="content">“We travel around Wisconsin, and   we also travel when we're on tour. We were just in Lexington, Kentucky   and we thrifted all day and performed at night, and we came back through   Indiana, and thrifted some more,” Dunis says. </p>
        <p class="content">“It’s like a treasure hunt you're   always looking for something you think someone would like. That’s   different than shopping for yourself, you don’t have to worry too   much about the size or the cut,” she said.</p>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4"><strong>R</strong></span><strong>e-Threads</strong>, which has locations   in both Milwaukee and Madison, also has a buy-sell-trade concept. For   Re-Threads selling vintage clothes is more than having a one-of-a-kind   item, it’s about recycling fashion, and is a greener approach to shopping,   says the Madison store’s manager, Trisha Griffith. <img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/trisha.jpg" alt="trisha" width="313" height="345" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">“I think there’s too much that’s   mass produced already and it’s ridiculous,” Griffith says. “There’s   so much clothes out there. There’s no reason we should be making so   many clothes.”</p>
        <p class="content">Their buy-sell-trade concept is also   perfect for a business opening up in the worst of economic time. You   don’t necessarily need money, or much of it, to shop at Re-threads.   Griffith believes that will be part of the store’s success. During   a time where people seem to be cutting back on life’s little luxuries,   a customer can come to Re-Threads treat themselves without spending   too much money. </p>
        <p class="content">“People that can’t afford to go   out and get clothes right now can come in here and sell their own clothes   here and get some new clothes without breaking their pocket books,”   Griffith says. “It’s nice –you bring in your old stuff that's   special, but you want something new, and you get that cool winter coat   you wanted that no one else has.”<img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/rethreads.jpg" alt="rethreads" width="258" height="292" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">Griffith specializes in finding the   best vintage for the store, especially being located on a college campus   where vintage isn’t exactly readily available. The Milwaukee store   will often send the Madison location some of their vintage items. </p>
        <p class="content">The two locations differ vastly. The   Madison location is smaller and more like a boutique, while the Milwaukee   location is as large as a warehouse. There is a tornado of old chairs   spiraling around the interior, old doors mounted on the walls, and old   suitcases and trinkets on tables next to racks of clothing. The Madison   location plans to hang tables and chairs from the ceiling, display furniture   on platforms, and will be expanding their selection, especially the   men’s wear. </p>
        <p class="content">“We're going to have different stuff   in here all the time,” Griffith says. “We appeal to men, women,   and we also have the furniture and the little knick knacks. There's   always going to be something you want to come in here and buy no matter   your age.”</p>
        <p class="content">The owner, Beret Issacson, came up   with the idea of opening a store after working at Chicago’s Buffalo   Exchange, which the store is modeled after. Re-threads took that concept   and added their own twist to it by selling furniture and handmade knick-knacks   and trinkets. </p>
        <p class="content">The owner also hopes to franchise the   store like Buffalo Exchange, which has locations in most of the major   big cities. Opening a second store in Madison was the next logical step   because of how close to Milwaukee it was.  Getting the business   hasn’t been a problem; the problem has been keeping the shelves and   racks stocked.</p>
        <p class="content">“We seem to be selling more. We take   in a bunch of stuff, but that same day we sell more than we take in,”   Griffith says. “I'm having to do buying trips where I go to garage   sales, church garage sales, thrift stores, anything on Craig’s list   just to try and get more special pieces.”<img src="images/Fashionably Vintage/rethreadsrack.jpg" alt="rethreadsrack" width="389" height="272" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">Griffith is also finds herself being   a bit pickier in her selections. With it being a small store, she wants   every piece to be a desirable piece. Griffith believes we were all born   individuals, and that’s what makes vintage clothing so desirable.   There’s more to vintage clothing than the clothes on the racks. </p>
        <p class="content">“There’s something deep inside   of me whenever I see a vintage dress, a vintage men's suit, or anything,”   Griffith says. “I just have this nostalgia...I’ve always loved fashion,   and things were made really well back then. They’re so unique— there’s   just like this essence of history in them. I wonder where that person   wore this to, or I wonder what their lives were like.” </p>
