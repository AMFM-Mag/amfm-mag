        <p class="content"><img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/defendblackshirt.jpg" alt="defend" width="250" height="233" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4">I</span>n 2003, people watched as Hurricane   Katrina destroyed one of the most cultural and historical places in   the United States. Floods swept away not only that culture and history,   but the homes, belongings and loved ones of the states’ residents.   Since then, New Orleans has been struggling and working hard to rebuild   the city, and reclaim the title of the “big easy.”</p>
        <p class="content">Prior to Hurricane Katrina, <strong>Defend   New Orleans</strong> was just a popular clothing brand, but after the devastation,   the name took on a different meaning. Having seen success pre-Katrina,   with its message of having local pride, the widely known t-shirt brand   began gaining more momentum post-Katrina as a message to viewers—defend   New Orleans.<img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/DefendNewOrleansJoinDNO.jpg" alt="tshir" width="180" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">Defend New Orleans founder, <strong>Jac   Currie </strong>(and cousin of Ellen DeGeneres), saw the involuntary show   of support from the people, and decided to take their idea and run with   it. Currie began selling the t-shirts and merchandise to directly benefit   programs to help rebuild New Orleans. The sales have been used to aid   Bridge House, Emergency Communities, Tipitinas Foundation, NORF, New   Orleans Musicians Fund, Renew Our Music and Acorn. <img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/t-shirt-purple.jpg" alt="tshirt" width="180" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">Since Hurricane Katrina, the company   has “sold 10-20,000 t-shirts, and raised over $20,000 for nonprofits,”   according a profile on the company. To keep hopes high, Defend New Orleans   hopes to foster more support for New Orleans and continue the current   message, although Hurricane Katrina is a memory of the past.  They   continue to throw parties with local musicians and artists to show why   we all fell in love with New Orleans in the first place. </p>

<p class="content"><strong><u>LEGALIZE LA</u></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/legalizelakids.jpg" alt="legalizekids" width="305" height="305" hspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4">C</span>alifornia is composed of mostly immigrants,   most of them coming from the Sunshine State's neighbor Mexico. California,   the home of many industries, is described as the 'manufacturing   hub' of the nation. Businesses have exploited immigrant workers to operate   shady under the table workplaces for illegal immigrants. They do the   work, yet the companies get paid. Some undocumented workers are working   two or more jobs and barely getting by, even though they're working   60 to 70 hour weeks.  <br />
          <br />
          There are over one million undocumented workers in the Los Angeles area   alone. The problem isn't that they are undocumented, the problem is   that our country doesn't address the fact that immigrants help our economy   flourish, yet some don't think we owe them recognition and legitimization.  <br />
          <strong> <br />
    American Apparel</strong> and founder <strong>Dov Charney</strong>, has become the   voice for Los Angeles' stance on immigration reform, and is spreading   that message to the rest of the nation with their line of t-shirts 'Legalize   LA.' The proceeds from the t-shirts are donated to Los Angeles immigration   rights groups. This cause has become a core part of the company at large,   because it is an issue they face every day--they employ over 10,000   people worldwide according to their web site.<img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/legalizelashirtf.jpg" alt="tshirt" width="199" height="222" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /> <br />
          <br />
          American Apparel prides itself in the fact that its products are made   in downtown LA, rather than in a sweatshop somewhere overseas, and that   they do not exploit their immigrant workers. The message is all in equality.   A person that works in the US, helps the US prosper, and pays taxes   should definitely be granted citizenship in that country. <img src="images/Clothes with a Cause/legalizegaytshirt.jpg" alt="legalize gay" width="262" height="243" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /><br />
          <br />
          Another set of shirts also vouching for equality, are the 'Legalize   Gay' t-shirts, which are a play on the Legalize LA shirts. American   Apparel began passing out the shirts to protestors in response to the   passing of Proposition 8 which banned same sex marriages in California.   They began selling the shirts in store and despite vandalism and threats,   the shirts have become another worthy cause American Apparel is standing   behind.  <br />
