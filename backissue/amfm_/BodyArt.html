In the meantime they have literally become canvases for  works of art. Tattoos have definitely become more artistic than your typical  skull and bones, or banner with an ex's name. They have come from being a  cultural taboo to a cultural norm, one body and one tattoo at a time. <br />
            <br />
            According to a Harris poll conducted in 2003, 16 percent of all adults have at  least one tattoo. The number is even higher for those between the ages of 18 to  25. A Pew Research Study found in 2007 that 36 percent of young adults have  tattoos. And you can't just have one—once you get one you want more. Some have  even gone to say that getting tattoos can be addicting. <img src="images/Body Art/drea.jpg" width="266" height="353" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /><br />
  <br />
            Andrea Smith of He Say She Say has seven tattoos at the age of 24. When asked  if she planned on getting more, she admitted that she had an appointment to get  one the following Wednesday. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;They're sooo addicting!&quot; Smith says. &quot;You get one, you get two,  and then you need to fill space, and you get more ideas for the art,&quot; she  said. Smith has two tattoos on her collarbone, three on her left arm, one on  her right wrist and one behind her ear. &quot;I think after the first one I was  addicted to them,&quot; Smith explains. &quot;I don't know if I even like them.  I just keep getting them,&quot; she said. <br />
  <br />
            Tattoo artist, Bryan Jansen, 40, has been tattooing for over 20 years since  1990 when he was offered his first apprenticeship. He loves tattooing because  he loves the idea of making a living doing what he loves—art. Both of Jansen's  arms are completely covered with vibrantly colored tattoos. He got his first  tattoo when he was 18 in the kitchen of the house he was living in by the drummer  from NOFX, who was staying at his house at the time. Jansen says knowing what  he knows now as a tattoo artist, he would have never even let the guy touch him—the  drummer tattooed like ten people in a row...<br />
  <br />
            <img src="images/Body Art/brian.jpg" width="300" height="399" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />That wasn't the end of the road for Jansen; after all, he is all sleeved out.  His spent his last $65 on his next tattoo, done professionally of course.&quot;It was one of those situations where it was all  the money I had in the world and I spent it on a tattoo,&quot; he says.  But it was totally worth it because through that first mark, he was able to  find something that he had a passion for. Hanging out in tattoo shops and  helping with designs got him to where he is today. He no longer has to worry  about spending his last dime on a tattoo. The idea of tattoos being addictive  is more of a hyperbolic statement to Jansen.<br />
  <br />
  &quot;You know, people say 'Ah they’re addictive' and you know that conjures up  an image of people waiting outside my shop in the shadows, waiting for me to  open, you know,&quot; Jansen says followed by a laugh. &quot;But, I don’t think  it’s that, I just think people really like the way they look, so they want to  get more. You know, it’s not like 'Oh I gotta have this,' it’s just they really  enjoy the image, and there’s just something about personal adornment, you  know,&quot; he said. <br />
  <br />
            Carrisa Stukey, 28, responded without any hesitation when asked if she felt  that tattoos were addicting. <br />
  <br />
  &nbsp;&quot;I think it’s like people who color their hair a lot,&quot; Stukey  explains. &quot;You get an idea in your head about something you want to do—or  like people who cut their hair a lot. I’ve actually gotten to the point where  I’m like well, I have this whole arm planned out, but there’s so many more I  have in my head. Should I get another one? A whole nother' sleeve?&quot; she  says.<br />
  <br />
            Stukey didn't get her first tattoo until she was 26 years old. She wanted to  make sure she knew what she wanted before she made such a permanent decision.  And she's glad she waited, it stopped her “from running out and getting  something like a tramp stamp when she turned 18.” She remembers that when she  was younger she always imagined herself as a &quot;bad ass full of tattoos and  piercings.&quot; She even wanted to get F*ck you etched into her arm, but she  <img src="images/Body Art/carrisa.jpg" width="240" height="361" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />decided that maybe that wasn't the best decision. She now has four tattoos, and  F*ck you is not one of them thankfully. <br />

          <p class="content">Her  tattoos are more cheerful, her favorite being an elephant character from the  Island of the Misfits in the <em>Rudolph </em>movie. It makes her smile, as do  all of her tattoos. So does fashion, and for Stukey, the two go hand in hand. </p>
          <p class="content">Clothes,  shoes, and accessories are all ways of showing personal flair and  individuality. You can show your style by adding a hat, or choosing a certain  colored t-shirt to wear for the day. Or you could get a tattoo...Sammi  Skolmolski , 22, thinks of tattoos as the ultimate fashion statement, and  artistic expression. </p>
          <p class="content"> “I like tattoos because they are an extension of the idea  of fashion as art,” Skolmolski says.  “Tattoos  take the power of expression a step beyond material and transform the body into  the medium.” <br />
          </p>
          <p class="content">&quot;I’m  obsessed with fashion,&quot; Stuckey says. &quot;I think of it as an art thing.  I think of it as a statement piece that I’m going to have forever. I do a lot  of statement jewelry—I'll buy a lot of basics…and blend it with really  interesting things that are more noticeable…My forever jewelry is going to be  this arm,&quot; she says.</p>
