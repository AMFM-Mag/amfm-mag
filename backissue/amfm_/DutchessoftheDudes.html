      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4"><strong>D</strong></span><strong>uchess:</strong> a woman who holds the rank of duke in her own right<br />
          <strong>amfm Duchess:</strong> Gwen Stefani, Karen O, Emily Haines, Shingai Shoniwa, and Hayley Williams. </p>
<p class="content">These chicks definitely know how to rock. Surrounded by the men in their bands, these women are running the show with talent, style and grace. </p>
<p class="content"><strong><u>GWEN  STEFANI</u></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Dutchess/nodoubtpic.jpg" alt="nodoubt" width="300" height="296" hspace="10" border="2" align="left" />Gwen  Renée Stefani Rossdale <br />
          Front  woman of No Doubt (vocals and guitar)&nbsp; <br />
          Born  in 1969, which would make her fabulously 40<br />
          Anaheim,  California native<br />
        </p>
        <p class="content"><strong>Why  She Rocks:</strong> First of all, she's got tons of titles under her belt-  singer, once solo, and with No Doubt for nearly two decades, designer of her  L.A.M.B line, SAG award nominated actress for her role in <em>The Aviator</em>,  and just being down right cool. Gwen Stefani captivated us all with No Doubt's  song &quot;I'm Just a Girl&quot; from their Tragic Kingdom album, which made the  band a household name. People wouldn’t see this much girl power until the  Spice Girls. When they play that song on tour, Stefani gets down and gives the  audience 10 push-ups, whilst singing--that's impressive in itself. </p>
        <p class="content">What  Stefani's got going for her is that she's one of the guys, yet so obviously a  knockout in all departments. Her signature vibrato ska voice just adds to the  mix. She's definitely a fashion icon--she has this edge to her. And let's  not forget about the abs! Not only is she 40,  but she has had two children. Stefani is living life in a boy’s  world, with husband, Gavin Rossdale, and sons, Kingston and Zuma. With her  platinum blond life and ability to actually pull off bright red lipstick, she's  a modern day Marilyn Monroe. </p>
<p class="content"><strong><u>KAREN  O</u></strong> </p>
<p class="content"><img src="images/Dutchess/yeahyeahyeahs.jpg" alt="yyy" width="342" height="310" hspace="10" border="2" align="left" />Karen  Lee Orzolek <br />
          Front  woman of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs (vocals)<br />
          Born  in 1978, which would make her 31<br />
        South Korea  native, New Jersey raised<br />
        </p>
<p class="content"><strong>Why She Rocks: </strong>Karen O is the epitome of that rock star aura. Coming  onto the scene with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs <em>Fever to Tell, </em>O established  herself as an artsy punk princess, and now she has sort of evolved into this  indie queen. On that album, she is able to go from fast tempo punk influenced  songs like &quot;Date with the Night&quot; to the indie classic  &quot;Maps.&quot; She's always got this funky thing going on with her hair  whether its long or short. </p>
<p class="content">She really has a stage presence when she performs.  She's so into the crowd and the performance and she has a certain stance, and  does this finger shaking thing. She's been known for the attention grabbing  clothes she wears on stage, and in videos. (That leather studded jacket from  the &quot;Zero&quot; video was to die for.) At this year's Lollapalooza, she  walked onto the stage wearing multiple feather headdresses, and has worn  everything from kimonos, to plastic dresses. A lot of the awesome clothes she  wears are designed by her close friend Christian Joy. O also has some side  projects she's done, including another band called Native Korean Rock, and  composing all of the songs on the <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em> soundtrack.  Karen O is definitely the face of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.</p>
<p class="content"><strong><u>EMILY  HAINES</u></strong></p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Dutchess/Metric.jpg" alt="metric" width="398" height="312" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />Emily  Haines' name is actually Emily Haines<br />
          Front  woman of Metric (vocals, piano, guitar)<br />
          Born  in 1974, which would make her 35<br />
          New  Delhi, India native, Toronto, Canada raised<br />
        </p>
        <p class="content"><strong>Why  She Rocks: </strong>I've bowed down before this rock goddess before, and it  wasn't demeaning; it was uplifting. Emily Haines of Metric is amazing on stage;  it's like she goes into a musical trance. She plays the guitar, the piano and  rocks a synth like no other. You  see her rocking back and forth intensely.  Her hair completely covering her face, while she's worshipping the musical  gods, only you're worshipping her. </p>
        <p class="content">There are many musical sides to Haines, she's  in the collaborative group Broken Social Scene, and has released two solo albums  that show a softer side of the singer and showcases her piano skills. Haines is  not only the front woman to the band, but also to lead guitarist James Shaw. They  formed a band, later becoming what we all know as Metric. She's got legs for  days, which she always showcases with shorts and dresses and paired with boots  or heels. You can't help but be drawn to her, be it visually or sonically, she  pulls you in her trance and you'll be gone for days. </p>
        <p class="content"><strong><u>SHINGAI  SHONIWA </u></strong> </p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Dutchess/noisettes_band.jpg" alt="noisettes" width="438" height="251" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />Shingai  Elizabeth Maria Shoniwa&nbsp;<br />
          Front  woman of the Noisettes (vocals, bass, guitar, cello)<br />
          Born  in 1980, which would make her 29<br />
          South  London, UK<br />
        </p>
        <p class="content"><strong>Why  She Rocks:</strong> This chick is awesome! She's got awesome hair, awesome  style, and mad skills. Not only can she shred a guitar, but she can rock out on  the bass and the cello. She adds so much versatility to the music of the  Noisettes, which is a indie-rocker spin on old&nbsp;1930’s jazz and  blues. &quot;Don't Upset the Rhythm&quot; from their album <em>Wild Young Hearts</em> is a perfect example of what the 1930's meshed with indie tunes would sound like.</p>
        <p class="content"> Shoniwa's voice is fresh, and the Noisettes are really adding something to the  music scene out there that's different. She has been known to throw a good  party-- the Noisettes are known around the UK as one of the craziest acts in  London. She's been known to perform barefoot and wear tribal face paint at  times. Her eclectic style is mix of a bit of everything from rocker to tribal.  Her killer coif also adds to her cool persona. She often dons feathers in her  hair, has interesting asymmetry, and can really pull off one big earring.  Shoniwa definitely takes the lead of this pack. She's is an African queen, and  it's suitable--her mother is from Zimbabwe. <br />

        <p><span class="content"><strong><u>HAYLEY WILLIAMS</u></strong></span></p>
        <p><span class="content"><strong><img src="images/Dutchess/paramore.jpg" alt="paramore" width="321" height="343" hspace="10" border="2" align="left" />Hayley Nichole Williams</strong> <br />
          Front woman of Paramore<br />
          Born in 1988, which would make her 20<br />
          Meridian, Mississippi native, Franklin, Tennessee raised<br />
  </span></p>
        <p><span class="content"><strong>Why She Rocks: </strong>Hayley Williams is the fire that keeps Paramore going,  with her red hair, exceptional vocal skills and Southern spunk. She's the  youngest duchess on the list, and she's already running the show. The dudes of  the band, who had already been formed had been a little apprehensive about  bringing some estrogen into the scene, but it was the best decision they ever made.  </span></p>
        <p><span class="content">Williams and Paramore have since done three albums, and their breakout album <em>Riot! </em>was a huge success. Williams proved that she's no chick to mess with when  they came out with &quot;Misery Business.&quot; </span><span class="content">She can rock and prank around  with the boys, and hold her own quite well. Her voice is so versatile that  she's able to go from hard to soft, and always keeps you guessing. It has a  really lovely acoustic quality to it, and there's something about the way she  enunciates her words that keep you hanging on her every word. At the ripe age  of 20, Williams has even more evolving to do! </span></p>
