That saying pretty much sums up the making of the second issue of amfm, for me as the editor, for the fans, and the artists featured in this issue. With the first issue coming out way back in December, this one’s been a long time coming, but it’s finally here!<br />
          </p>
          <p>amfm has come a long way since the first issue. We have moved to the California coast, built a greater fan base, and have transformed from college magazine to the real world of print. We are even on Facebook now! Issue two is bigger and better than I could have ever imagined. <br />
          </p>
<p>Art enthusiasts will be excited to read our feature on LEGO art, featuring one of the nation’s greatest LEGO artists, Nathan Sawaya, and local California LEGO prodigy David Tracy. Their LEGO creations will take your thoughts of art to a whole new level. If anyone is in dire need of patience it would be these two. </p>
          <p>Our music artist of the month this issue is California's Nico Vega, a trio of musicans who were drawn together by a deep respect and love for making music. I had the pleasure to see this band open for Metric in Oakland, and immediately fell in love with their energy and stage presence. Nico Vega is a treat to see on stage, and it was truly a treat to land a Q&amp;A with the frontwoman, Aja Volkman. </p>
          <p>Nico Vega, and all of the artists featured in this issue were really an inspiration to me in the making of this issue. Like Sawaya, who found solace and passion in colorful LEGO bricks, or for Evan Christian who discovered himself when he discovered the guitar and Europe. Or companies like 410 BC or the designers featured in Eco-Fashion, who strive to help the world by making environmentally friendly fashion pieces. </p>
          <p>They all have such a positive outlook on the world we live in, and aren’t afraid to go out and make their dreams come true. <br />
          The dream of just doing what you’re passionate about, whether it be flying to Spain to learn how to play flamenco guitar, or by making clothes you believe in. All of the artists featured in this issue inspired me in some way. Their passions fueled my passion for writing. amfm is a dream come true, whether there is one reader or a hundred. </p>
