      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4">W</span>ith a nickname like Freako Rico, you definitely have to be a character. The man behind the nickname is Atlanta artist, Richard Montgomery. He got the name from classmates who knew him for his &quot;relationships with the ladies,&quot; if you get my drift...He admits that he didn’t like the name at first, but later began to fully embrace it and almost brand himself. For people that know Montgomery, they know him as a crazy and out there friend. They also know that he makes art, sometimes naked, but nonetheless good art.<span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/freakorico/art2.jpg" alt="art" width="324" height="325" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></span></p>
        <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/freakorico/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="263" height="124" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></span>For Montgomery, art isn’t just something he makes, it’s something he does. He says he can’t help but paint. It’s his sense of freedom, peace, and at times gives him the same pleasure as sexual stimulation. It gets the blood pumping, perhaps that is because according to him he’s been making art his whole life.</p>
        <p>“I’ve been creating since before I was born,” Montgomery says. “I did my first piece in my mother’s uterus. Literally.”</p>
        <p>Maybe it was entitled “My Umbilical Cord.” From then on Montgomery grew up in after school art programs and summer camps in pre-school and middle school, and he continued to study art in high school and college. </p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/freakorico/art3.jpg" alt="art" width="290" height="269" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />When asked who are some artists he admires, he gave a surprising answer. </p>
        <p>“I admire children's art. It’s so pure and innocent,” Montgomery explains. “Their work is overlooked by us adults. Sit down and draw with a four year old, you might learn more than you will in a college drawing class.&quot;</p>
<p>Another artist that Montgomery admires  is the late great, Jean-Michel Basquiat. Some people compare some of Montgomery’s pieces to the Basquiat style, but he insists that he doesn’t feel that his artwork is like Basquiat's at all. He says he isn’t mimicking his style either, but there are some striking similarities. The use of color in the face pieces, the characters he creates, even down to the use of words on the pieces. </p>
        <p>“I just go with what I feel, and most of my work has more meaning to the people who view them, than to me,” Montgomery says. “I literally just like how the colors blend, or how the lines curve. It’s just paint.”<img src="../images/issue 2/freakorico/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="254" height="127" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p>It’s that same mentality that Basquiat seemed to have. Something that comes so naturally, doodles even, can be great works of art to others, but simply just the norm for the artist. Montgomery admits that his attitude towards his work is more similar to Basquiat than the actual work itself. </p>
<p>“I like his life more than his work. He was an artist. He wasn’t in all of it for money, he just wanted to live and do what he wanted with his talent, that’s all he knew,” he says. “I just want to create. Honestly, if I didn’t have to eat, I would give my work away for free. I just want to make God’s kid’s happy. It feels good to be compared to him, but I still want to make my own way.”</p>
<p>  Montgomery’s newer art appears to be  a symbol of the propaganda saturated times we live in. Right now he is using a lot of paper scraps he says he finds on the street, or print outs from ads like Nike, Adidas and American Apparel paired with cartoon caricatures on acrylic. His older pieces were inspired by his older brother who told him he “needed to do art that ‘black people’ would like,“ ironically Montgomery laughs and says, “white people bought them.”<img src="../images/issue 2/freakorico/art6.jpg" alt="art" width="298" height="363" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p>Art knows no color, art <em>is</em> color, and something all cultures in the world share. Day to day life, family, strangers even, and the world that we live in inspires Montgomery to make art. “Not the people side so much,” Montgomery says. “I pay attention to nature and wildlife even though I don’t directly incorporate it in my work, but it’s in there.”<img src="../images/issue 2/freakorico/frko1.jpg" alt="frko" width="237" height="239" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></p>
        <p>He had the opportunity to have his art displayed in a popular Atlanta coffee house  centered around music and the arts, Urban Grind Coffee. He wouldn’t call it a exhibit though.</p>
<p> “It always feels good to show what I make. I didn’t have a show there though,” he says. “It’s a coffee house you know? I wouldn’t be able to show up barefoot  or nude at my show.”</p>
        <p>Perhaps in the future he will have a show, and the world will get to see who Freako Rico really is,<em> all of him.</em> For now, he’s taking the name to a whole new level. </p>
        <p>Montgomery is also into the whole street culture lifestyle, street art, and especially BMX. He has a whole bike crew of friends and they make videos all over Atlanta under the name FRKO. He is now taking that nickname he got in 8th grade and branding it even further with a little project he calls The FRKOMVMT he plans to start this summer in Atlanta. </p>
<p>“It’s basically a non-profit clothing line, stickers, and of course related to art,” Montgomery says. “If I do start to sell, I will send all proceeds to homeless kids all over the world. I just want to help because I care.”</p>
