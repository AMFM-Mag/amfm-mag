          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> how did you get into DJing? </p>
          <p><strong>DJ FORTUNE:</strong> I first saw DJ's perform in the UK during the eruption of the rave culture when I was 15. It wasn’t until I was 23 that I tried it myself. I started learning properly just before I turned 25 and purchased my own gear shortly after. <img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/fortune2.jpg" alt="fortune" width="428" height="570" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>how long have you been a DJ?</p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE: </strong>11 years </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What kind of music do you spin? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE: </strong>It varies from House to Tech House to Minimal, Techno and even Dubstep on occasion. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> how does it feel to be a female DJ in a male dominated field?</p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE: </strong>I could write a book on this topic. It's weird. It's complicated. I feel honored and frustrated like it's made too big of a deal of for the wrong reasons. And yet I think it's a big deal too, because why the hell aren't there more girls DJing??! I feel a lot of responsibility to represent women in the strongest light possible and be an example to other females who want to branch into traditionally non-female roles, or live outside the box. I believe anything is possible, go out and take it. I hope I present that to others. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>what about music moves you? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE: </strong>Music has the ability to take you to another realm. When you find a piece or type of music that resonates within you, it has the power to evoke an emotional or even spiritual response no matter what your surroundings, who you are with, or what you are doing. It can heal, evoke anger, joy, and release stress. Music has great power. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Do you think a DJ can save lives? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE:</strong> A DJ can happen to be in the right place at the right time, creating the right type of set that speaks to someone in a way that changes their world completely, yes. But a DJ is nothing without music. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> what is your favorite part about DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE:</strong> My favorite part about the act of DJing is mixing. When both tracks are in, creating something truly unique. Playing with the sounds to create different effects and evoke different reactions, almost remixing the tracks. I like to take risks mixing, doing what I feel in that moment, regardless of rules. Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't! But it allows me to be spontaneously creative. When it does pay off, the sound coming out of the speakers is something I didn't anticipate and neither did the crowd, but its right, and everyone feels it ...that's the ultimate. </p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/fortunepullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />amfm: </strong>How did growing up in Bristol shape the DJ you have become? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE:</strong> I heard my first mixtape in Bristol. I was maybe 14, hanging with a bunch of skater kids and they put on a tape of this new stuff...it was early Jungle. Massive Attack impacted me deeply. Local Bristol DJ, Bungy gave me my first mix tape, and it opened with a four Tenors opera piece, Nessun Dorma, and right at the crescendo, he dropped in a Jungle track that blew my mind.</p>
          <p>I grew up surrounded by a whole variety of brilliant music. Bristol was vibrant, and England embraced electronic music period. Really the way i grew up has influenced me to be very broad in my EDM appreciation. I have never found it possible to be loyal to one genre. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Having played the flute, sax and piano when you were younger, how do your instrumental skills influence your skills as a DJ? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE:</strong> I had a head start. I know basic music theory, counting beats and playing in key is natural, I don't have to think about it. </p>
          <p><strong><br />
          amfm: </strong>What have you found difficult about DJing? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE: </strong>Being disciplined. I understand the rules of music; however, it can makes me less careful. I take risks, drop tracks where I shouldn't, and mix sounds that I know probably won't go together. But I know there's a way to make it work. I want to break boundries, not abide by them! Not always a good thing. </p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/dubstep.jpg" alt="dubstep" width="212" height="210" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />amfm:</strong> How does House music speak to you differently than other types of music? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE:</strong> It doesn't necessarily, sometimes it's a Minimal track or a Techno mix.<br />
I think its the 4/4 beat that is what I always come back to. I love Jungle, Hip-Hop, and some Dubstep, but the four count is where I'm most at home. I actually find that I am most often affected by rhythms rather than melodies, vocals and instrumentation. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Did you get any good advice from DJ Qbert when you met him? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE: </strong>Qbert...practice. [He’s a] three-time champion of the world, and he practices all the time.<br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>If you weren't a DJ what do you think you'd be doing? </p>
          <p><strong>FORTUNE</strong>: Dancing!! </p>
