          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> how did you get into DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>DJ CHARLIE HUSTLE:</strong> My love for music comes directly from my Dad, who has owned a bar in Milwaukee for over 30 years. He taught me that the most important part of running a successful bar is the music. Everything else comes after. My Dad's extensive knowledge of music and his application of that knowledge into owning and operating his own business was what inspired me to become a DJ. <img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/charlie.jpg" alt="charlie" width="417" height="554" hspace="5" align="right" /></p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> how long have you been a DJ?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE:</strong> I have been a DJ since infancy! I have pictures to prove it! However, I became conscious of being a DJ in my teenage years when I spent a lot of time in my basement. In the basement, I stumbled across thousands of records that were once used at my Dad's bar and quickly comandeered them for myself. While other kids played with video games, I played with vinyl! </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> what were the other possible DJ names you thought of?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE: </strong>There really weren't any other DJ names. I had other grafitti names, but no other DJ names. I got the name Charlie Hustle from a few different people at different times in my life. In my early teens, I ran the streets of my neighborhood as a stick-up kid and small time criminal. I can't get too much into details, but that's how I got nicknamed Charlie Hustle, because I was hustling, literally. Also, somewhat random, but I used to go to Marquette University basketball camps under former coach Tom Crean an one day I drove to the hoop for a lay up and got pushed to the ground, but I still made the basket. Tom Crean saw what happened and helped me up, slapped me on my ass, and said 'nice hustle kid'. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What kind of music do you spin?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE:</strong> I spin all kinds of music, but primarily Hip Hop, Funk, and Soul.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How does it feel to be in the Bronx where hip hop was born?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE: </strong>I'm living my dream. I can't put into words how I feel. For me to have come where I come from and now be living in the Bronx rubbing shoulders with people I consider legends is a miraculous story. I have friends that are dead, in jail, or addicted to drugs and alcohol, and may never get to live their dream like I am doing. I count my blessings everyday and always stay humble. It's overwhelming sometimes. <br />
          </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Who are your DJ idols? Have you met any legends living in NYC?</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/charliepullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="250" hspace="5" align="left" />HUSTLE:</strong> My DJ idols are as follows: Kool DJ Herc, DJ Afrika Bambaataa, GrandMixer DXT, Jazzy Jay, GrandWizard Theodore, my partner Danny Dan The Beat Mann (Dusty Fingers), Kid Carpi, Lord Finesse, The X-Men crew, and Roc Raida to name a few. I've met most of these DJs since moving to New York and actually had the privilege of hanging out with some of them. My encounters withmy DJ idols have humbled me tremendously and inspired me to work harder. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What have you found difficult about DJing?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE:</strong> The most difficult thing about DJing was carrying records, but since Serato came out, DJs no longer have to carry crates of records everywhere, so now the hardest part for me is dealing with people's requests! Ahhh! It seems like a lot of young people are programmed to listen to the same 5 or 6 records over and over and over again. I like to be different and expose people to music they have never heard, but sometimes it's hard when all people want to hear is what is playing on the radio. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How does DJing in your hometown Milwaukee differ from in New York? Do people like the same types of music? Is the vibe of the crowd different?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE: </strong>There isn't to much of a difference in DJing in Milwaukee as compared to New York. It really depends on the venue and the crowd. That's where you find the most differences. Different circumstances call for different types of music and a good DJ is able to read his crowd and play for the people. The DJ sets the tone for people to have a good time. I've found that if I'm having a good time as the DJ the crowd will follow, no matter where I am. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Was there anything pivotal in your childhood or adolescence that sparked your interest in DJIng?</p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE: </strong>My life experiences greatly influenced my interest in DJing. Growing up in a poor, working class community, I witnessed a lot of suffering. At the heart of my passion for DJing is a desire to help people. I believe in the healing power of music, so as a DJ I use music to heal by literally organizing people under the principle of having a good time. When I DJ if I can make someone who is having a tough time smile or even dance, then I know I've succeeded.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> what was going to Scribble Jam like as a kid?<strong><img src="../images/issue 2/thatsmydj/scribblejam.jpg" alt="scribble jam" width="248" height="212" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></strong></p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE: </strong>Scribble Jam was an amazing experience. I got to meet Immortal Technique when I was 15 at Scribble Jam and I also met BK One at Scribble Jam and he told me he actually grew up on the same street as me just a few blocks away. I loved Scribble Jam because it showed me that I could indeed be a DJ.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Does your work in Urban Development complement your work as a DJ? </p>
          <p><strong>HUSTLE: </strong>My work in Urban Studies goes hand in hand with DJing. I believe a DJ can be a community organizer, a political activist, and even a revolutionary. DJs speak directly to the people using the language of music, which to me is one of the most powerful and transformative forms of communication ever known to man. </p>
