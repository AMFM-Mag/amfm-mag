      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/410lookbook2.jpg" alt="410bc" width="568" height="371" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />amfm:</strong> In what ways does 410BC represent a lifestyle?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC:</strong> 410 BC has been called a lifestyle brand, which is defined as “a brand that embodies the values and aspirations of a group or culture.” I think a lot of our customers have similar values and that is one of the reasons they pick 410 BC. We are known for promoting conscious consumerism and giving back to artists, and that attracts people with certain beliefs to want to support us.  </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> In what way is 410 BC wearable art? Who have been some of your favorite artists to work with?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC:</strong> 410 BC tees are wearable art in that every design is unique and created by an artist or designer who is making their living by creating art. A lot goes into producing each tee. We’ve worked with many different artists over the years and now have a few who work exclusively for us, full and part-time. Some of our favorite artists we’ve worked with in the past (many of whom have designed multiple tees for 410 BC) include but are not limited to: Elena Gallen, Matthew Skiff, Ray Frenden, Josh Clancy (Toothjuice), HermanLee of FRESHFAUXX and Ronald Ashburn of Electrik Suicide.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/pullquote3.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="215" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/pic6.jpg" alt="410bc" width="230" height="344" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />amfm:</strong> You said you wanted the name of the line to have meaning, how did the name 410 BC fulfill that?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC: </strong>410 BC stands for the year that democracy was restored in Athens. The Athenians were at war, but they managed to restore their own institutions. This name represents a myriad of ideas, but especially the idea of standing up and fighting for what you believe in. We apply this name by refusing to cut corners in order to save money when it comes to our products. We want to promote conscious consumerism, which is something we all believe in at 410 BC.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How do you incorporate athens and history into the line?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC: </strong>A lot of our designs often follow that theme, although we let a lot go to the artist’s discretion. The majority of our tees represent that theme. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>410 BC is much more than a clothing line, can you explain a little bit how 410 BC is a collective and community?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC: </strong>We work with a lot of people and actively try to work with as many artists as possible.  It was always important for us to have a brand that is a collective of people working together, which is why we chose to run the company this way. We’ve also collaborated with a lot of artists in our local community and even collaborated with local producers and another independent brand in the past. <img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/410bcbox.jpg" alt="boxes" width="276" height="235" hspace="5" align="right" /></p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How does 410 BC strive to be ethical in its approach to make fashion for the masses?</p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/410bc/pic2.jpg" alt="410bc" width="200" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="0" align="left" />410 BC: </strong>We have donated proceeds from tees to not for profit organizations, we helped to put on a fashion show and donated tees to the organization which benefited children who were victims of abuse. We try to do things like this as often as we possibly can. We also produce only sweatshop free products that are made in the US. We try to utilize organic cotton and other organic materials whenever possible. </p>
<p><strong>amfm: </strong>Why do you think the tee shirt has manifested such a legacy? </p>
        <p><strong>410 BC:</strong> I think tee shirts have stood the test of time because they are simple, comfortable and don’t fall out of fashion. Everyone loves tee shirts!</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How are you guys still growing and expanding? What's next for you guys?</p>
        <p><strong>410 BC: </strong>In the near future we have more tees coming out, we are going to start doing monthly tee releases. We also have a new line and some more cut and sew products in the fall. We are also releasing new skate decks very very soon. We are at a point where we need to wait and see where the brand goes next. 410 BC has always surprised me and so whatever happens next I’m sure will be no exception.</p>
