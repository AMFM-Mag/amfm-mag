      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“When we saw this dude, man it sounded like it was three guitars. It completely messed me up. I was just looking at the TV like that’s impossible, that’s not just one guitar. I was like rewind it, and from then on I was just screwed up I had to go to Spain, and that’s what started it for me,” he explains. “I didn’t choose it, it chose me. If that makes any kind of sense to anybody ever. Where I come from that wasn’t playing on the radio,” he explains and laughs.</p>
        <p>From that day forth, Christian was obsessed, determined to master the guitar and place he had never been before. He made a leap of faith and bought a one way ticket to Spain to learn flamenco. He didn’t know Spanish, where he would stay, or how long he would be there, but for Christian going to Spain was one of the best decisions of his musical career. </p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/evanchristian/evan5.jpg" alt="evan" width="506" height="310" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />“If I didn’t go to Spain and go where no one knew me, get my ass kicked musically, and put myself in that situation, I wouldn’t have started singing,” he says. “I had to start singing over there to eat. I was like don’t nobody know me, I’m just gonna try it, see what happens, and people clapped! So I tried another one, and another one.”</p>
        <p>Christian jokes that he hates his voice. He never thought his voice sounded good, so he never set out on singing. That’s awfully modest considering his soulful croon is along the lines of Bob Marley, Citizen Cope, and Dwele, and has that Neo-soul flavor that’s rough around the edges. </p>
        <p>He’s a little bit rock and roll too, like the musical grit of Caleb Followill of Kings of Leon. His genre-bending inspirations are made most apparent at his live performances where he will strum Led Zeppelin’s “Stairway to Heaven on his guitar, and buss into Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg’s “Ain’t Nothin’ but a G Thang.” </p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/evanchristian/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="224" hspace="5" vspace="10" align="right" />“My mom is responsible for exposing me to a lot of different music, playing classical music a lot, oldies, teaching me about music,” he says. “I grew up listening to good music, always, so I’m grateful for that, cause it was already in there.” </p>
        <p>Christian says both of his parents were born with this musical talent. His father played the trumpet in high school, and his mother played piano by ear growing up. She taught him how to play when he was really little, so Christian has always had an ear for music. </p>
        <p>Being the youngest in his family, Christian comes off as a free spirit. He has two older brothers and an older sister, and he says he was always the odd one out, the adventurous one that has gone the completely different route in terms of how he lives. </p>
        <p>He says he never said to himself ‘I wanna be a musician’ growing up. It was just something he would do for himself while he was hanging out in his room at home listening to rock songs his friends had turned him on to.</p>
        <p>“These songs would get stuck in my head and I’d come across a guitar and I was like I’m gonna figure this out, and I would,” he explains.“They get stuck in there, and then they torture you until you get it out. That’s how you learn. I don’t think everyone should learn it the same way. No diss to the Suzuki method, but not everybody learns that way.”</p>
        <p><img src="../images/issue 2/evanchristian/evan4.jpg" alt="evan" width="237" height="294" hspace="5" align="left" />Christian laughs and says he feels like an ‘imposter’ having this huge tattoo of a treble clef on his back when he even can’t read treble clef. He never learned how to read music, yet he’s creating these amazing notes when he plays. </p>
        <p>He believes that when you’re tied to notation you risk losing your creativity, and your ear, especially when it comes to things like improvisation. “In essence you’re always reading what somebody else wrote already,” he says. “Those notes might not be for you, somebody else wrote that.” </p>
        <p>Christian’s impromptu music is even better than his written songs, because you’re in constant amazement that he’s making it all up as he goes along. So when you get the opportunity to hear his performances, you are really getting all of Evan. No two shows are ever the same. It depends on the mood and the vibe in the room, the venue, and in his case, the country. </p>
        <p>“Generally the people over there in Europe generally are genuinely into music, live music. The fans over there are cool people. They want to see somebody playing and dance, stuff like that. It’s a little less inhibiting,” he says. “But it ain’t nothing like The States. It’s nothing like Chicago and Milwaukee and little clubs.”</p>
