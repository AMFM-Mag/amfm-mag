      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/evanchristian/fuego.jpg" alt="fuego" width="212" height="225" hspace="5" align="left" />E</span>van Christian was born in Chicago, and raised in Milwaukee, but his heart resides in Spain. At the age of 32, Christian has already traveled Europe once, stone cold broke with nothing but some clothes, his guitar, and copies of his first solo album, <em>Fuego</em>. But, he had only one way to move, and that was forward.</p>
        <p>Christian often jokes that his guitar is his girlfriend, wherever he goes, she goes. It’s a love affair that will never end. For the past few years of his music career, Christian has been doing his solo thing. Formally performing with The Evan Christian Quartet, he has found it easier to just hit the road and do gigs, just him and his guitar. He wrote many his songs being a struggling musician in the streets of Europe. <span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/evanchristian/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="250" height="198" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></span></p>
        <p>“I wrote many of these songs in intense pouring rain, starving and freezing on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere,” Christian explains. “When you have to play to eat, and your hands are freezing, you have to play to live. You got to live to make music.”</p>
        <p>And that is exactly what he is doing. With a his new album, <em>The Mosaic</em>, to spread to the masses, Christian has decided to head back to Europe to live in his former stomping grounds and biggest inspiration, Spain.</p>
        <p>“My favorite place is Grenada, in the whole wide world. Right now at least, out of all the places I’ve been. I feel like I have something to do there, I don’t know,” he says. “It’s such an inspiring place for me. Everybody’s got that thing y’know, to each is own. I’m gonna finally take some flamenco lessons, some guitar and singing lessons, record, and enjoy.”</p>
<p><img src="../images/issue 2/evanchristian/evan6.jpg" alt="evan" width="510" height="253" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Christian is a self-taught flamenco guitarist, but that doesn’t sum him up. Don’t put him in a box, he doesn’t like that. Go to a show of his and you’ll understand why. He’s like a king when he walks into the Jazz Estate in Milwaukee on Wednesday nights. </p>
        <p>The venue is one of the oldest in Milwaukee, and is so underground you feel like you’re in New York during the Harlem Renaissance. He takes his throne on the stage with his queen in his arms, and the crowd loves him. He beat boxes, he sings, he taps his guitar like Kaki King, and he can play a guitar like no other. </p>
        <p>“I hate being typecast,” Christian says. “Dudes like Beck, Prince, and Radiohead can do anything and still be accepted. I want to be like that.”</p>
        <p>Christian admires real music. He feels like the late 60’s and 70’s were the best musical eras because all of the changes were good for music, with these musical gems emerging onto the music scene. He feels that being an artist isn’t just about making a great studio album, it’s about the ability to connect with people, and captivate an audience of thousands or even as little as 40 people. </p>
        <p>“There’s only a few things that can translate race, social, economic status, language,” Christian explains. “Not many things can do that, few things, but there are some things, and music is one of them. Everybody loves music.”</p>
<p>Having taught himself basic guitar by listening to old rock albums, and these crazy riffs he found stuck in his head, flamenco was something he never thought he would do. Christian remembers the first time he heard the flamenco guitar style. He was at a friend’s house watching a video of The Spanish Grammys, when flamenco guitarist, Tomatito came on for his set. Christian was immediately drawn to the sound, and was completely mesmerized at how quick the guitarist's hand movements were. He said to himself, “I want to do that.”        </p>
