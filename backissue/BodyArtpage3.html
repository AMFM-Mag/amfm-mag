        <blockquote>
          <p class="content">Steve Agee, 42, is sort of an older person with  tattoos; he has six. He got his first after being persuaded by his friend from  high school, and like Jansen had it tattooed  unconventionally in a house rather than a  tattoo parlor. His tattoos all <img src="images/Body Art/steve.jpg" width="265" height="328" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />seem to remind him of something in his life. One  of them was done freehand by a friend, another commemorates his appreciation for  vegetables, which he fondly refers to as &quot;my veggies,&quot; and another  was done by Limp Bizkit front man Fred Durst, before he was famous, in exchange  for $30 and a lamp Agee agreed to make him. <br />
            <br />
Mulaney's parents are also two of those older people that don't like tattoos.  She describes her parents as conservative, especially her father. Her mother on  the other hand, doesn't hold as strong feelings against them, but that doesn't  mean she likes them. <br />
<br />
&quot;My mom has warmed up to the idea of tattoos,&quot; Mulaney says.  &quot;She prefers them to be inconspicuous. There’s a woman at her job who has  a big calf tattoo and never covers it and my mom says she just stares at it all  the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thain says having a bad or ugly tattoo is like having a &quot;bad hair  cut&quot;—only forever. That's not as bad as some of the disturbing tattoos  Krysta Eder, 25, says she has seen. She remembers seeing a face tattoo of a  skull. Skulls are ghastly enough, let alone on your face. <br />
<br />
&quot;I’d say, for some reason the face thing is just too much for me. I’ve  seen like full body tattoos except for the hands, feet, neck and face, and I  think those are nice. That’s way too much for me, but they're okay,&quot; Eder  explains. &quot;I guess when you start losing yourself in the tattoos that’s  when it becomes too much. I see faces as people’s identity, that’s how you  recognize someone. Once you take that way and cover it up you’re changing who  you are.&quot;<img src="images/Body Art/pullquot5.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /><br />
<br />
Some tattoo enthusiasts would say that part of getting a tattoo is changing who  you appear to be by adding a symbol that represents who you <em>really </em>are.  Everyone's going to recognize the guy with the skull tattoo on his face, but  they won't see him, they will see his skull. Agee says people rarely think about  what these things are going to look like when they get older. <br />
<br />
&quot;[It's] up to the individual. I personally wouldn’t do it,&quot; Agee  says. &quot;I would never tattoo my face...I just wouldn’t—it’s too much. Cause’  eventually you’re going get old and look like you’re wearing a quilt or  something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eder believes that when people get tattoos, they should consider the aesthetic  appeal. She feels tattoo styles have definitely changed over time, and people  are really able to cultivate an art out of it. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a lot of friends that have tattoos and they are pretty creative  with them,&quot; Eder says. &quot;Unless I get something very meaningful, I  wouldn’t want to get a tattoo. My friends are so creative with them, it makes  me feel like I need to be extra creative with one.&quot; <br />
<br />
The creativity is all in the art—the ancient art. And like art, not all people  will appreciate them. People should however, expect to see more of them. They  aren't going away anytime soon. &quot;You know, someone turns 18 everyday...&quot;  Jansen says.<br />
