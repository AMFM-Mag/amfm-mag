        <p class="style4">FROM DJS TO DUO</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="style4">W</span>hen Chess Hubbard and Jessica Gonyea of Moneypenny met over duck fat fries at Hot Dougs in Chicago, it was a match made in heaven. A love for fries was not the only thing they would find  they had in common. The long time friends would both soon become established DJs  in the Chicago music and nightlife scene.</p>
<p>Hubbard, also known as DJ Mother Hubbard, was a well known fixture in the Chicago nightlife scene. She was part of creating it. In 2003, Hubbard got started as an intern at Chicago Metro, and eventually that turned into a work opportunity for her.</p>
          <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/MotherHubbard2.jpg" alt="chess" width="266" height="397" hspace="5" align="left" /></span>From then on she made all the right connections, teaming up with Chicago talent buyer Chris Baronner and kick starting “Life During Wartime” Chicago’s longest running dance-party-social. This took her around the world, DJing with great names, and would eventually lead to her next two ventures, event promotion and artist management companies, En Prise and UR Chicago with her business partner Matt DuFour. With these two platforms, Hubbard was well involved with the local Chicago music scene.<img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="378" height="62" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
          <p>As was Gonyea also known as DJ A-Cup. She was already on the radar with her band Office, which was a Chicago pop band with a classic cult following managed by DuFour. The band gained a lot of momentum, making top 20 on iTunes and being signed to indie label Scratchie Records started by former Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha. The band was also featured in a number of publications like <em>Spin</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em> and <em>NME</em>. The band began living life in the fast lane, being flown out for “random gigs in New York and Los Angeles.” This all took a toll on Gonyea's <em>real</em> job.</p>
          <p>Gonyea tried her hand at DJing as a way to pay her rent, because the constant traveling made it hard for her to keep a steady, and conventional job. Little did her bosses know, that their work disadvantage would be Gonyea’s and Chicago’s advantage. She learned to DJ from her boyfriend, Du Four, who had learned from Hubbard. And it turns out, she was better than him! She figured since the turntables were around she might as well learn. Thankfully she did. <img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/jessica3.jpg" alt="jessica" width="265" height="428" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" /></p>
          <p>And thankfully they both decided they wanted Hot Dougs and were in the right place at the right time, in line right next to each other. “She got the last available duck fat fries and I challenged her to a thumb war for them,” Hubbard says. “She won, but felt sorry for me and gave me some anyway.” Gonyea attests to that, adding, “Those fries are magic.” </p>
<p>Magic is what happens when two young DJs at the top of their game decide to team up and make beautiful music together. They began working together, putting on shows as an electro-DJ side project, Rocktapussy. By a fluke, their first show was opening for Robyn in April of 2008 in front of a sold out audience at the Park West in Chicago. Rocktapussy made quite a buzz in the underground music scene repping it as a female DJ duo, so they decided they better get serious.<img src="../images/issue 2/moneypenny/moneypenny.jpg" alt="moneypenny" width="190" height="326" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></p>
          <p>“After forming Rocktapussy, I realized I missed making original tunes with my old band,” Gonyea says. “We got a couple friends to get us into their studio, and the first two songs were promising enough to lead us into expanding the project further.” </p>
          <p>Despite the fact that they loved the name, changing their name was also a part of expanding the project.The name, Gonyea says was good for drawing attention and getting people to stop and look at their posters; however, Hubbard adds that, “People either loved or hated the name Rocktapussy,” she says. “We didn't want people to dismiss us thinking we were a joke band on account of the name.”  In April 2009, Rocktapussy became Moneypenny.</p>
<p>So it’s okay for guys to have a band name called The Balls Band and The Big Brass Balls Band, but not okay for these two lovely ladies to take the name Rocktapussy and own it? I guess it comes with the territory of being a female.</p>
