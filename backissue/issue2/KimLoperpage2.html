      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/kimart2.jpg" alt="art" width="441" height="438" hspace="5" align="right" />amfm:</strong> What about the female body inspires you the most? </p>
        <p><strong>KL: </strong>The female body has meant so many different things throughout time. Different skin colors hold different histories. Different body types carry different political meanings. I want to strip these bodies of their associations, but embrace the depth of these associations at the same time. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What about the human body intrigues you? </p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> What's most interesting to me is that the body is such a basic, necessary entity that becomes manipulated, abused, misused and objectified, but revered and coveted all at once. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How does feminism play a role in your art? </p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> I haven't figured out an answer to this question, but I think there's an undeniable feminist approach to the way I seek to explain the female, and male, body. Any time a woman is in control of her art, or woman is the voice in an a piece, I think it's feminist. </p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How does sexuality play a role in your art? </p>
        <p><strong>KL: </strong>My sexuality is not who I am; its just a facet. Homosexuality becomes an alternative, whereas heterosexuality becomes normative. Everyone has a sexuality, and everyone needs to explore that and be critical of what that means, whether it be privilege or disadvantage.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/pullquote3.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="251" height="198" hspace="0" vspace="0" align="right" />amfm:</strong> Why is it important for you to portray these things? </p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> Because I have such ambiguous feelings about these issues, so I know that’s what I need to try and figure out. My art is kind of like a question and an attempt to answer without a conclusion.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What would you say to someone who felt that your art was taboo? </p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> I would say they're closet freaks.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> With such provocative art, what provokes you and will continue to evoke you?</p>
        <p><strong>KL:</strong> What provokes me are my dreams, my fears, insecurities and shame. All the things I don't know how to deal with are things I will continue to find an evocation for.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How have your travels influenced your art? </p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/issue 2/kimloper/kimart8.jpg" alt="art" width="427" height="225" hspace="5" align="left" />KL: </strong>There are so many similar experiences people share from across the world that become isolated because of history. I want to know why the same situation carries such different weight for different people, and how they can intersect. I love culture, food, music, politics and learning. That's corny as hell but traveling is the ultimate learning privilege, about others, but mainly about oneself. I get the most self reflective opportunities when I leave my comfort zone.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Why do you feel that art education is important? </p>
        <p><strong>KL: </strong>Art reflects the society it was produced in. It also fuels our society, so we can't study history or teach without art.        </p>
