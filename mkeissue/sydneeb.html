      <p><strong>Sydnee B</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Syd Bencriscutto grew up surrounded by music, it&rsquo;s no wonder he named his  album <em>Role Model</em>, he was surrounded by them. With a mother who sang in local bands, and a father who played the keyboard for a local soul group, he was destined to become the versatile rapper Sydnee B. With a number of influences, he went from rapping at an early age for his classmates, to landing a record deal in the Virgin Islands after high school, to starting his own independent label Tippy Top Entertainment. <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">He wants to help put Milwaukee on the map with his talent and drive. Starting from his basement, all he can see is his journey to the top, and with his record label he hopes to bring others along for the ride. With influences of rock, hip-hop, reggae, and dubstep, his songs cannot be contained to one genre. One thing they definitely are though are club bangers, and songs that bring out the youthful carefree vibe of living every day like it&rsquo;s Friday, even when you&rsquo;re about your business.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">amfm: </strong>Where did you get your musical influence from? What are some of your earliest musical memories?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">sydnee b: </strong>My musical influence to me is infinite. My inspirations started at an early age listening to Pearl Jam at my parents&rsquo; backyard BBQs. My mom and dad had a one acre backyard and would have live bands play on the porch with like 100+ people. My mom was the lead singer in a number of local bands. She actually to this day has played like 100 times more shows than I have haha. My dad also played the keys for Harvey Scales &amp; The Seven Sounds when he was younger. He tells me all these stories about the crazy shit they would get into when he was on tour with them. I have some catching up to do! My older bro was also in a band, even my lil' bro plays guitar and the piano. So basically pursuing music was not a weird thing to do in my family.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">amfm: </strong>How did you get into making music? What has your musical journey been like?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">sydnee b: </strong>I got into making music when I was in 6th grade. We were in English class and we had some assignments on the subject of poetry, and me being pretty convincing and lazy, I asked the teacher if I could just write a rap instead, she said yes. Shoutout to Mrs. Spencer! But what I would do is just memorize some Outkast lyrics and change em up a little and call them mine. Eventually I started rapping out loud to all my friends, songs I thought they wouldn't know like &quot;Pretty Willie.&quot; I bet you still don't know! &nbsp;All of my friends would be like &quot;damn bro, that was kinda good.&quot; So eventually I started writing my own songs. I started with a little flexible computer mic, acid pro 4.0 in my dad's basement. It basically became an obsession. I found it as a way to channel all of the million thoughts that go through my head and kind of slow them down for a minute, it was basically therapeutic for me.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">amfm: </strong>Why did you start Tippy Top Ent.? What are your aspirations for the label?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">sydnee b: </strong>I started Tippy Top Ent. when I realized that there is no point in waiting anymore. Everything that labels used to do for their artists can now be done by the artist themselves if they are determined enough. Tippy Top Ent. is a way for me to give back and &quot;assist&quot; other artists that deserve recognition to reach their audience. We wanted to provide something that was never provided for myself as an independent artist. <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">amfm:</strong> What was the inspiration behind your album Role Model? What were you trying to say with this debut album?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">sydnee b: </strong>&quot;Role Model&quot; is basically my statement to the world that you don't have to be defined by anyone but yourself. As an artist I never let anything cloud my inspiration, if it feels right, I go for it. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">amfm: </strong>Who are your role models? Either in music or in life.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">sydnee b:</strong> My role models....this question is awesome. My role models would definitely have to be, in no specific order of course, Bob Marley for his glowing aura of positivity. Tupac Shakur for his militant aggression for human rights, and Michael Jackson for making conscious music about self consciousness. This list could go on forever. I know how it sounds, but I'm all about uplifting the world with music, and anyone that can do that is a role model in my world.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">amfm: </strong>You're a newcomer to the Milwaukee music scene, what do you think about Milwaukee's music scene and being a musician in Milwaukee?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-22fdf420-25fd-42cc-4bc4-e7794d8d5088">sydnee b:</strong> I think the Milwaukee music scene is a ticking time bomb really. I look around and I see a number of artists that are on the verge of bringing Milwaukee to that national platform. You have artists like Prophetic, Klassik, Fresh Cut Collective, Webster X, and Gerald Walker. &nbsp;All of these people are really raising the bar for the Milwaukee music scene and it's not only healthy for the music, but it's making noise. The world won't be sleeping on Wisco much longer let me just say that.      <br />
