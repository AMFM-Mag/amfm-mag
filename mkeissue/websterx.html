      <p><strong>Webster X</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Sam Ahmed was a stoop kid with a dream and and a soul full words that were waiting to be released. A year ago, he would have never imagined he&rsquo;d be where he is now. Webster X is a culmination of those words like the dictionaries they came from, he spits rhymes about the times that he came from. His first release <em>Desperate Youth</em> is a nod to the creativity, the mentality, and that cool of today&rsquo;s youth who hold endless possibilities at their fingertips. <em>Desperate Youth </em>is a fresh spin on old hip hop vibes, sort of like Odd Future tripping on Camp Lo<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">He practically went from performing in Urban Outfitters, where he works, to countless shows in Milwaukee overnight. And who would have thought it would have been possible for a kid who wasn&rsquo;t sure where to channel his talent to be performing on a stage at South By Southwest in his first year on the scene? A year ago, Sam might not have. The words just got bigger than himself and they had to be released somehow, and it&rsquo;s a sure good thing they did or many ears wouldn&rsquo;t know the wonder that is Webster X. </p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>You seem to have just burst onto the scene overnight, how did you get into making music? And you&rsquo;re studying creative writing at UWM?<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: </strong>I truthfully did burst out of nowhere, I feel like my life has been a lot of that. A lot of cool and random things popping out of nowhere reason being why I live my life in a very go with the flow mentality but also balancing it out with control. Balance in life is a very key thing for me. I started off writing free form poems, just random things that meant a lot to me, lots of word play, but no set structure. They always rhymed though, and yes I'm studying creative writing at UWM and it's awesome besides the actual school part of it.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm:</strong> In a video diary you put out, you said you were hesitant to initially put yourself and your music out there, why was that? What helped you get over that, and how did it feel to get such positive reinforcement? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x:</strong> I think the main reason I was hesitant was because I didn't feel that comfortable yet, which is natural. I also had no clue where to put my stuff honestly. I pushed myself to my limits as I still do with everything in life today. Getting the positive reinforcement was absolutely overwhelming and it still is. For awhile I didn't think about how much it was spreading, but now I do realize how many people are being affected by music, especially live performances, they're a whole different level.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>Your Desperate Youth mixtape has an old school hip-hop vibe to it with some modern trippiness, what was your intent behind choosing beats? How would you describe your music? Who are you influenced by musically? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: &nbsp;</strong>I think the best part about Desperate Youth looking back was that I didn't have too much intent. I was just like &quot;okay I have this concept and I'm gonna run with it.&quot; For me Desperate Youth means young people in our generation trying to succeed and do really cool things, and live adventurous and enlightening lives. When I chose beats I was pretty much like &quot;alright this sounds awesome, I'm gonna write to it.&quot; As of now, the next album is gonna be a bit more thought out than that. I'd describe my music as completely experimental. I'm influenced by so much that I truly can't fall subdue to just one genre. I'm listening to King Krule and a bunch of other random good tunes as I'm answering these questions. In terms of influence in music, I'm heavily drawn into jazz, classic, current hip hop, psychedelic rock, some folk, a lot of ambient instrumental, and a whole lot of everything.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>What was the inspiration behind Desperate Youth? What kind of statement are you trying to make about the youth today? <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: </strong>The inspiration of Desperate Youth was from my life prior to the album, everything I've experienced, what I want for this city, what I want for the world, which is literally just peace and love as cliche as it sounds. I wanted to start something real for people here. Something cool and original and have it spread, hopefully inspire some minds to be driven and cooler than myself.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>Tell me about your connection to the RooSevelt Collective. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: </strong>&quot;The RooSevelt Collective&quot; is my group of friends basically, an art collective. In a sense that went through its own phases, to be honest that name is pretty dead now but the unity between us is stronger than ever. Hence, why you will be seeing a bunch of different things coming from us from live performance visual art shows to photo and video as well as musical releases and in the near future a new name as well. Things are about to get real dirty.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>Coming from someone who was hesitant to get out there, your stage presence has such hype energy, what is performing like for you? Where was your first show and what was it like? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: </strong>Live performance I've learned is one of my most enjoyable activities, if not my favorite, in terms of being an artist. My first show was at the Landmark basement bar, actually my first two shows. Myself and my rap buddy, Ryan Haller, just went out there with no knowledge or real sense of live performing, oh how that has changed now. We treated shows how we would treat house parties we went to early in college/late in high school and people liked it. As of late I&rsquo;ve been trying to make every setlist for every performance different, but usually around the same songs, sometimes I do new stuff, sometimes I don't, what i want truly is for people to leave that venue and have faith in music from Milwaukee, because I do. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>How has Milwaukee had an influence on you as an artist and what do you think of Milwaukee&rsquo;s growing music scene? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: &nbsp;</strong>Milwaukee is a part of my soul, and my soul is a part of Milwaukee, I don't know if the scene has been this lively, but people have been telling me that it's at its greatest as of right now which feels amazing to be a part of that. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>How did you come upon the name Webster X? </p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: </strong>Webster X came about when I wrote my first real verse, to my first real song every recorded. The line goes &quot;expressing my feelings through a plethora of isms, malism, racism, egoism, where's the rhythm, someone pull out *websters*, we tryna keep pace with him&quot; from there I was like, wow i really do love words. Just looking at words, reading, intrigues me. The X is tagged on from our parents generation, being &quot;X.&quot; I read in a book once that our parents were supposed to carry on enlightenment to the next generation <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">amfm: </strong>You went to South by Southwest this year, how was that? </p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-71e64715-1b70-334e-5ce8-eceb75e0e341">webster x: </strong>SXSW was really awesome, the entire experience as a whole was so overwhelming especially for a little guy like me who just hopped onto the scene. Opened my eyes to how much I really have to do now, it's time for the next level, it truly is time.</p>
