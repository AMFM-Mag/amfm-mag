      <p dir="ltr"><strong>MilwaukeeHome</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">Melissa Thornton started MilwaukeeHome without the intention of it being anything more than a thoughtful gift for a friend. A hoodie design turned store and company is serendipity at its finest. Home is afterall where the heart is, and our hearts are often worn on our sleeves. The brand, which she describes as &ldquo;built by the city,&rdquo; really rings true. Milwaukee has embraced MilwaukeeHome, making it the brand of the city. It is well on it&rsquo;s way to becoming more than that, with a city full of momentum, MilwaukeeHome is starting a movement of recognition. They even are sponsoring a stage at the large music, art, film and industry festival, South by Southwest this March to bring awareness to all of the amazing talent this city has to offer. </p>      Milwaukeeans have a certain pride about them, repping their cities on their chests, on hats, and even in tattoos. MilwaukeeHome has something for everyone, the wine lover, beer drinker, babies, sports enthusiasts, and anybody with a dream. Amongst a slew of local wears, most known for their t-shirts, hoodies and tanks, MilwaukeeHome stands out with it&rsquo;s simple design and aesthetic, just like the city they come from. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>How did you get the idea for the MilwaukeeHome sweatshirt concept? I also read something about you seeing Helvetica (amazing documentary by the way) and it inspiring you.</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">milwaukeehome: </strong>The idea and concept came to me one day when I was sitting at my computer just messing around trying to create a t-shirt for me and a sweatshirt for my friend for Christmas. I wanted something to show that Milwaukee was home to me. So with the design background I have, I started laying out the words Milwaukee Home in Helvetica, which I have to say is my favorite typeface. When I graduated from MIAD in 2002, you could have sworn I hated that typeface. I felt it was too easy, but as I become a more evolved designer, I had learned throughout the years that it was not only the simplest typeface, but it was clean and timeless. I did end up watching the documentary, Helvetica, which proved to me, there was no better typeface in the world. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>It&rsquo;s such a simple, yet clever design, playing with letters. How has the aesthetic of the shirt allowed for you to play around with it or do special collaborations? What are some of the partnerships, collaborations or special designs you have done?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>I really try to stay true to my brand. I will always keep the design of MilwaukeeHome clean, simple and timeless. By just removing the O in HOME, I found a &quot;home&quot; for those I collaborate with. &nbsp;Nathan Showers, owner of Rogues Gallery, has been a huge supporter of what I've been doing and has helped carry events and celebrations over at his bar. So I decided he would be my first collaboration where we added his skull logo to the MilwaukeeHome design. Then just two months ago I was approached by the Milwaukee Bucks, which I was so excited about. What a great opportunity for the brand, but also for people of the city that love the Milwaukee Bucks, but what to wear something created locally. Again, I replaced the O in HOME, with the Buck logo. Super excited about that. And now I am in the middle of talking to the Milwaukee Wave, hoping we can collaborate as well. Another way I've collaborated is with local musicians or events, I have created a special color edition for them. Last year we created for John Revord, another great supporter, a special two year anniversary shirt for Hotel Foster on North Ave. I also have created some special edition shirts for a couple musicians, such as, Klassik, Corey Jay and Phillyflyboy. And this is just the beginning. There is so much we can do and collaborate on, I really am looking forward to the future. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm:</strong> Did you ever think you&rsquo;d get the response or reception from a single time gift you made for someone?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>Never, because I wasn't thinking about anyone else when I designed it. I just designed it because I loved it and I loved Milwaukee. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>You went from one hoodie to a store, how have you seen the business and brand evolve?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke:</strong> I am close to 18 months in, and I had not even dreamed it becoming a brand for the people of the city, and that is exactly what it is. It has become the flag of pride for all those who call Milwaukee home. I've seen people actually tattoo themselves with the MilwaukeeHome logo, and that right there has shown me that I really have created something bigger than myself. I have created something from my heart, that has connected to everyone who has seen it, wears it or just supports it. The city as a whole is coming together to show their love and support for Milwaukee and that is really exciting. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>Why did you want to make something as an homage to Milwaukee?</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke:</strong> After being away for five years and moving back to Milwaukee, I finally felt settled, like this is home and I did not have to venture off to find my place. Milwaukee is where I belong. <br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>Where were you living before you decided to return to Milwaukee? What made you feel like you wanted to stay?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>I moved to Orlando FL in 2006 and lived there for a little over five years. It was good for me to experience time away from home, because when I came back, I appreciated this city with a new perspective and a new energy to really create something here. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>What were you doing before Milwaukee Home? did you have a design or retail background?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>Well, I graduated MIAD in 2002, and then worked at Nonbox which is an advertising agency for four years. Then I moved to Florida and worked as a creative consulted at a company called Cult Branding for seven years. When I moved back to Milwaukee, I was still working for Cult Branding up until March of this year, and I then transitioned into making MilwaukeeHome my full time job. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>Was it your dream to own a business or have &ldquo;the&rdquo; brand of the city?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>That&rsquo;s funny you ask that. When I moved back to Milwaukee I wasn't sure what I was going to do, but I remember talking to my mom on the phone telling her that I felt like it was &quot;My time to leave my mark.&quot; I had no clue what that meant, and two years later I've created a brand for a city that I am proud of because it was all created out of love I felt and now we all get to share it as a collective whole. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>How does MilwaukeeHome span farther than Milwaukee?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke:</strong> I'm not sure yet, what that means, or what that looks like. And I'm okay with that. Right now, Milwaukee deserves a brand for themselves and I just want to focus on that for now. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>&ldquo;A brand built by the community&rdquo; what does that mean to you?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>Yes, I designed the mark, the logo, but every time someone wears it, they are asked where they got it. If they are away from home it starts conversation and it brings people together all over the world. Its really the people that built it into a brand all because THEY WORE IT, THEY SUPPORT IT, THEY LOVE IT….and that I am forever grateful. Word of mouth has really made it into what it is today. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>How many people are on the Milwaukee Home team? who is involved?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>I have two part-time employees that work the store and help out at events. But the majority of it, is me trying to do everything I possible can. However, I have a really good group of people around me everyday that I can bounce ideas off, or learn something from. I am surrounded by entrepreneurs every day, people who are also creating a better Milwaukee. I am thankful for them, because if it wasn't for them, I would probably go crazy, hahaha. &nbsp; <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm:</strong> It seems a lot of people from Milwaukee who live in other places for any period of time often come back, what do you think it is about this city that makes people return home?</p>
      <strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>What makes Milwaukee, Milwaukee, is the people. &nbsp;We are a different breed. We are like a small community in a big city. We are hard working, kind and truly appreciate our seasons. We are a creative community filled with passion and love for our home, our city. I love it here, and I love Milwaukee-ans, period. <br />
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">amfm: </strong>How will MilwaukeeHome continue to grow? What&rsquo;s next for you guys, more shirts or something bigger? I feel a movement happening. </p>
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-3ed9ad1f-3d7e-d66b-2d2e-05a344c3c2d8">mke: </strong>MilwaukeeHome will continue to grow organically. And I know the movement is and has already started. I want to ride the wave and let it be what it is suppose to be. There will always be new merchandise, but its so much bigger than that. I am excited for it to grow this year and to expand to everyone. I have a feeling that its not going away, it will leave its mark and I am truly grateful and excited for whats to come. </p>
