        <p dir="ltr"><strong>Dear Milwaukee,</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I came back to Milwaukee because everything I loved was here. It&rsquo;s home. Home isn&rsquo;t always a place. It&rsquo;s that comfort you feel when you&rsquo;re in a room with family or friends, sitting around a table eating together. It&rsquo;s when you dance so hard at your favorite bar that you sweat. When you&rsquo;re at a show and you hear a song that moves you, when you see a piece of art that speaks to you, or when great minds come together to create something good and for the people. At least that&rsquo;s what home means to me. Milwaukee makes me feel like that. Milwaukee as a place may have it&rsquo;s issues, like segregation, education, and incarceration, but there is a thriving community of hard working, creative people, artists, thinkers, makers and doers, who are all trying to change that. Milwaukee is full of talent and potential.</p>
<p>MilwaukeeHome&rsquo;s motto is &ldquo;the brand built by the community.&rdquo; I feel like that&rsquo;s how Milwaukee is - a city built by its community. A city is as good as the people that reside here make it, and there are some great people here, whether they were invited here, have never left, left and came back, or left and stayed away. Milwaukee is branded in our hearts, and so many of the folks featured in this issue are chasing dreams and putting their hearts into it. <br />
</p>
<p> That same type of heart that I put into this issue. amfm is back with a new look and a new format and a celebration of my home. I want to thank all the artists for letting me tell their stories. And lastly I would like to thank Milwaukee for allowing us to dream.</p>
