      <p dir="ltr">Christopher McIntyre was the youngest artist to be included in the Wisconsin 30 exhibit to accompany the renowned 30 Americans exhibit at the Milwaukee Art Museum last year. But just because he&rsquo;s young, doesn&rsquo;t make him naive. He has seen a lot in these Milwaukee streets, and he has captured it with his camera. Because he didn&rsquo;t want to end up another statistic, with his camera, his words, and his drive, McIntyre took his future into his own hands, and changed his perception. He even legally changed his name to Christopher McIntyre Perceptions in that regard. </p>
      <p>His poetic images capture the culture of the city- the quiet normalcy, the dark nights and bright lights, and the constant hustle of it&rsquo;s inhabitants. His &ldquo;artlife&rdquo; demeanor and photography brings a semblance of heart to the bleak streets, the vibrant souls that reside here, and to creatives standing beside their city, trying to find a way to follow their passions against all odds. <strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>

with my life. In an environment that locked opportunity due to my age, pigmentation as<br />
well as my ethnicity, I rose by focusing on higher thoughts. I am a believer in Jesus Christ so it points to Him in this piece. If it had not been for God, I would have been dead or in jail a long time ago. The opportunity to showcase this piece in the Wisconsin 30 exhibition in the summer of 2013 as the youngest Wisconsin 30 artist meant a lot to me. 
It's beyond words. It was a community effort that I've never seen but sparked so many ideas, organizations and artists to rally together as a city. Milwaukee is on the rise. In less than five years, the world will know Milwaukee is an art city. We just must focus on positive thinking with action, higher thought is key.</p></td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td><p>Green is the color of life. In the hoods that I dwelled in and where I've congregated in, all you see is lifeless, motionless potential. But I also see duality, I call it the Whirlwind. High highs and low lows. Amidst all of this, I see innovation and hope in the eyes of children. They are the present and the future so all we can do is invest in living investments. And we must tell the children who feel like they can barely breathe that not only can you breathe...but you can fly little black boy...you can fly little black girl. You are the descendant of kings and queens, crafted by the hands of the Most High. Seek higher thoughts and focus on the light. And I promise...you will fly.</p>

          Cultivated in Milwaukee, I walked through the hood one day to spoke this fellow off the block cutting hair. He had his son next to him will taking care of a 'client'. It shows that Milwaukee is a hustle city and the hustle doesn't stop but you still must tend to family. God, family and business.</p>
