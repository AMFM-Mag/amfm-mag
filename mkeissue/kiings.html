      <p><strong>Kiings</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">DJ duo, chemists, &ldquo;ballers&rdquo;, and two souls of Milwaukee production royalty, Sean Foran and Chris Siegel, known as Kiings, came together one fateful day to hone in on their  craft of mixing and creating music that will awaken your senses. How can Kiings be explained in words? Just listen to their song &ldquo;Explain Myself&rdquo; sampling Quadron (who covered Lauryn Hill) over a seductive beat and you will understand these two DJs. Better yet, watch the video and see the quirkiness they manifest. Their music is sensual and sensory, and in their latest release they manage to make even James Vincent McMorrow even more enchanting. </p>
      <p dir="ltr">Kiings debuted on the Milwaukee scene last summer at Summerfest and they have hit the turntables running. They have done countless shows since, gotten some good press, have remixed Wisconsin, made their New York debut, are set to play Toronto&rsquo;s North by Northeast version of South by Southwest in the likes of some major music players, and all of this is before they&rsquo;ve even released their debut album due out this summer. A lot can happen in a year when you have people&rsquo;s ears at your fingertips.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">amfm: </strong>How did you guys start working together and what is it like DJing together as a duo? <strong><br />
      </strong><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785"><br />
        sean foran of kiings: </strong>Chris and I crossed paths practicing crossovers on the cold, mean, unforgiving basketball courts of Brown Deer, Wisconsin. We were young &ldquo;ballers&rdquo; in the making, attending Tom Crean Basketball Camps, hustling with Justin &ldquo;Yogi Bear&rdquo; Kirkey, struggling to secure our own places in the history books – little did we know that history always has a way of writing itself, or something like that...We transitioned to music production in our high school years, after our &ldquo;hooping&rdquo; abilities revealed their limits, the sky, alas, was not one of them. From then on, we would understand our destiny to involve sonic artistry. First and foremost, above all else, we are music producers, writers, and instrumentalists – our home is the studio, and our life is in the creation of a song. DJing is something that we enjoy doing, and that we believe we bring our own unique spin to, but for us, it&rsquo;s more of a secondary talent – a live expression of our craft. &nbsp;We DJ because as music producers who are not talented vocalists and lack a full band, it&rsquo;s ostensibly the best way of manifesting the soul of what we&rsquo;re about in a live setting, that, and because our mixes tend to incite instances of &ldquo;ass clap.&rdquo; We work well together as DJs because we have many similarities in musical taste, yet we have enough differences to mix things up. Our DJ sets are very spontaneous, and we work in whatever style is appropriate for the moment, the crowd, and the setting. Chris will do a 15 minute set, I&rsquo;ll do a 15 minute set, or we&rsquo;ll switch off every song.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">amfm: </strong>You describe yourself as chemists, how is DJing like chemistry? What do you love about music and DJing?<strong><br />
        <br />
        kiings: </strong>DJing is like chemistry in the obvious sense, mixing songs and sounds together at the right tempos, in the right keys, creating a recipe for life within the club, or bar, mixing hydrogen and oxygen together at the right temperature, within the right conditions creates water - a recipe for life, in general. That being said, I think we&rsquo;re much more like chemists when it comes to our productions – our own crafted songs. Chemists have the periodic table of elements to work with. &nbsp;We have the audible frequency spectrum and about a 100 decibel dynamic range to work with. When you include this concept into the way you think about sound and music, suddenly you realize the vast realm of possibility you hold in your hands when creating a production from scratch. What we love about creating music is that it may be the one area of our lives for which we don&rsquo;t have to hold back or compromise who we are. We don&rsquo;t ever limit our music with genre boundaries or to fulfill other people's&rsquo; expectations, rather we trust our gut instincts, which have been nourished throughout our lives by healthy musical ingestion and audio engineering education as we begin painting on our blank canvass. </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">amfm: </strong>You guys just played a couple shows in NYC and Philly, and are set to play NXNE as well. How do you guys feel getting this recognition and interest having just launched last summer at Summerfest?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">kiings: </strong>It feels like it&rsquo;s a good start, in terms of reaching people on a national and international scale. The opportunity to be able to tour heavily is something we&rsquo;re definitely looking forward to earning. Right now, we&rsquo;re just extremely focused on getting our debut album perfected.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">amfm: </strong>How would you describe your debut album and how has the process been going?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">kiings: </strong>The album will be the first 3D, 20/15 vision, voyeuristic look behind the curtain at Kiings. It&rsquo;s a culmination of what we&rsquo;re meant to do as Kiings. It feels like everything we&rsquo;ve learned, absorbed, and consumed in life is being vomited onto this album. It&rsquo;s been a peaceful purge – not without placating – putting everything in its right place, &nbsp;perfecting. And yet, it&rsquo;s only a beginning. The album will feature many inimitable vocal talents – Christine Hoberg, Rae Cassidy, Piper Davis and several gifted local Milwaukee artists are featured as well – Klassik, Gab from Vic &amp; Gab, and Colin Plant from Logic &amp; Raze. Two songs that will be on the album have already been released: &ldquo;You Can&rsquo;t See Me&rdquo; featuring Christine Hoberg, and &ldquo;Feel&rdquo; featuring Rae Cassidy. The rest is yet to come.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">amfm: </strong>What is the significance of your name Kiings? Why the two i's?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">kiings: </strong>It was a breezy, yet lukewarm, overcast day. I was floating on a raft in Lake Michigan. Chris was cooking shrimp fritters nearby on the beach. Suddenly, a morbidly obese, floppy man appeared in the sky. I nearly fell off my raft, but decided to sleep instead. Chris murmured, &ldquo;God?&rdquo; The sloppy man spoke, &ldquo;You are visionaries of euphony, hawk-eyes of harmony, seers of sound. You are &rsquo;Kings&rsquo; with two eyes – one eye for two souls; two eyes for the One.&rdquo; And so, Chris, being God-fearing in the presence of fritters, and I, being sluggish from slumber, became lost in translation. &nbsp;When we searched for ourselves, we found &ldquo;Kiings&rdquo; instead.<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">amfm: </strong>How has Milwaukee inspired you or benefited you as artists? What do you love about Milwaukee?<br />
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-205f0249-f233-eaca-27cf-13559a032785">kiings: </strong>Milwaukee is home – it&rsquo;s familiar; it&rsquo;s given us a great deal of what we know. We hope to return the favor. </p>
