      <p><strong>D'Amato</strong></p>
      <p dir="ltr">D&rsquo;Amato&rsquo;s soul was made to spread funk and love through his music, and he knew it at a young age. He is truly an old soul; it&rsquo;s not every day you meet a young white boy singing Prince when he was seven. In one of his songs he says, &ldquo;My life is the meaning of the term purple rain.&rdquo; With inspirations derived from funk, soul, jazz and the blues, he adds a flair of hip hop and comedy to his music. D&rsquo;Amato isn&rsquo;t just a musician, he also knows how to put on a great show like the legends that inspire him. </p>
      If you&rsquo;ve ever been to one of his shows or met him, it is obvious that he is at home on the stage. He often comes dressed to the nines in a suit with a guitar slung over his shoulder, and has a cadence like that of a preacher catching the holy ghost. Only in this case, the holy ghost is his music and the energy of his audience, who he is known to praise throughout his set. Not to mention he has a song called &ldquo;White Jesus and Me,&rdquo; where he questions the perils of life, which will be on his debut album &ldquo;Counterfeit Paradise&rdquo; out this summer.
      <p><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">amfm: </strong>How did you get started making music? How was D'Amato the performer born? Were you making music or doing musical things growing up?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">d&rsquo;amato: </strong>FAMILYFAMILYFAMILY. &nbsp;I grew up around instruments and dancing, and my Mother would sing to me every night. If music wasn&rsquo;t being played, it was being listened to. Soul to show tunes and everything in between. In my young mind, being a musician was the absolute coolest thing someone could be. I had to do it. </p>
<p dir="ltr">ALL PRAISE BE TO FAMILY. </p>
<p dir="ltr">As a lil&rsquo; one I started writing lyrics to existing songs. My clearest memories of that are writing lyrics over Cameo&rsquo;s &lsquo;Word Up&rsquo; and Beck&rsquo;s &lsquo;New Pollution.&rsquo; The earliest original lyrics of mine I rediscovered in a notebook date back to when I was seven. &nbsp;Some of these songs are shockingly morbid, like predicting my own death kind of stuff. In elementary school I was forming bands before any of us played instruments, and I was rapping - I rapped a lot. In the 5th grade I also started playing Alto Sax, and then in the 6th grade Baritone Sax, because I was the only kid big enough to handle it. Some time after that picked up guitar and bass, singing and rapping the whole time.  </p>
<p dir="ltr">I have only ever wanted to be a musician. &nbsp;And a Silver Back Gorilla. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">amfm: </strong>Your influences are rooted in funk and soul, what is it about that music that speaks to you and influences you as an artist? Have you always been into funk? Imagining a baby D'Amato bumpin Prince in his crib... </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">d&rsquo;amato:</strong> I have always been a wackadoo Funkateer, and I plan on dying a True Funk Solider. As with much in life, it&rsquo;s that mixture of nature and nurture, so I nurture my nature. &nbsp;Funk Life. Sonically and conceptually, Funk and Soul (and just as much the parents Blues and Jazz) hit me hardest. &nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve aged, what&rsquo;s captivating me are the actual personalities and events surrounding the music. Look at some of the game changers: Sly Stone, George Clinton, Amy Winehouse, Prince, Donny Hathaway, Miles Davis, James Brown, the list goes on…There is such trouble and pain and suffering within these individuals, and what do they do? They make music that COMPELS you to dance, that MAKES you smile, that allows you to forget about your problems, if only just for the duration of a song. Through crippling depression, anxiety, and addiction these people were able to turn their troubles into an artistic endeavor that, at it&rsquo;s base, is about love and understanding and unity. Rising above our own complications and making a statement that uplifts others is difficult. I find great truth and inspiration within that. It scares and intrigues me to think about how many of my heroes were/are addicts. I get really sad, I get really funky, but I refuse to get junked out. &nbsp;Hold me to that.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"> My earliest Prince memory is being babysat as a tiny boy by my late Auntie Tamara and listening to &lsquo;Girls and Boys&rsquo; off of the Parade album. This is a big reason, among thousands, of why I love Prince with all of my everything. &nbsp;I love him. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">amfm: </strong>Your shows are much more than just a performance of songs, you really are a showman and it seems like you enter this different realm when you're on stage, almost like a character of yourself, and then there's white Jesus… Why do you do that for yourself and the audience? What is performing like for you?  </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">d&rsquo;amato: </strong>I think my performing began as an attention getting thing, realizing as a child I could garner positive and negative reactions by acting out, singing, or dancing (in some small ways it&rsquo;s still like that, OH HOLY VALIDATION). My sisters quickly picked up on this impulse of mine and capitalized on my much younger, easily fooled mind and would force me into make-up and have me lip-synch to Madonna. Aside from that trauma, what remained most influential was my father with his adventurous and on point musical tastes. Growing up he would take me along to shows of all genres, and I got to see professionals in their element. &nbsp;Not necessarily within the moment&rsquo;s comprehension, but rather through how much fun I was having, I quickly realized you don&rsquo;t just show up and play music, you show up and you put on a damn show. You owe that to the crowd and you work for it. I do enter a different realm while on stage, and it is in no way a character of myself, it&rsquo;s a state of myself. The audience is viewing me at my apex, but if there were no audience, my apex wouldn&rsquo;t exist. A show should be like good love, we&rsquo;re both going to get there. I perform sober because I want to feel it all as is, good, bad, awkward, and if you see me indulging in substance after a show, it&rsquo;s to ease my performance comedown. It can be that powerful. I show up to work for the audience because that&rsquo;s all I want to do.  </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">amfm: </strong>What does D'Amato mean and why did choose that as your stage name? What is your real name, I don't even think I know it! </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">d&rsquo;amato: </strong>D&rsquo;Amato means love…Yeah, let&rsquo;s say that. I was born Adam Lawrence D&rsquo;Amato Werlein, but D&rsquo;Amato is my name. Not just on the stage, but everywhere. &nbsp;Unless you are my family or someone who&rsquo;s known me since adolescence, I respectfully ask you to call me D&rsquo;Amato. Or else I&rsquo;ll bite your finger. Adam died when Michael died. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">amfm: </strong>You're often on stage, and in person so gratuitous and humble, calling your fans beautiful, and it's all love. Why does making music make you happy? What else makes you THAT happy? </p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6e992d80-1326-dbc4-2da9-fd0e14d10895">d&rsquo;amato: </strong>All I want to do is write and perform music for people. If you leave your home, come to a venue, spend five to ten dollars at the door, and watch, listen, participate, you are actively making my life better. I hope I have the same effect on the crowd. I don&rsquo;t want to speak for my other musical compadres, but I&rsquo;d be willing to guess they&rsquo;d say the same thing. You are our therapy. I get angry, I get sad, sometimes I feel quite caged and anxious, and I do hope that shows in my music and performance, but through varying experiences I have found the only thing worth truly preaching is love. And I feel a deep love for those I encounter in Milwaukee and elsewhere. Through music I am afforded an opportunity to speak and be heard, so you best bet I&rsquo;m going to make that time worth as much as possible, spreading love, and doing it as creatively as I can. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What else makes me that happy? A stable and positive mental condition, my beautiful friends and family (Oh, how I Love them so!!!), comedy, romance, sex and animals. If I weren&rsquo;t actively pursuing music, I would be working with animals or children. I have found those are the only things that come close to matching my passion for music.<br />
