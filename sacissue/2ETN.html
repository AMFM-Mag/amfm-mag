    <td><p class="style4">Q&amp;A WITH 2ETN</p>
      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4">P</span>amela Tuohy of <span class="style4">2ETN</span> is many things— eclectic like her jewelry designs , a mix of vintage, green, and urban. She’s the kind of hip lady that will come to your roof party and speak french with all the kids, who will be out protesting at the Occupy Sacramento rally, and be dressed to the nines for an event the same night. <img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/2etn3.jpg" alt="pam" width="468" height="312" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
        <p>She exudes elegance and in return it shows in her work. Elegant like the strong and quiet buffalos and birds that she draws inspiration from, and from the beetles and spiders that show strength. She combines elements of hard and soft with the wrought iron recycled and vintage pieces that she works with, combined with the whimsical drawings of<span class="style4"> Ed Novinsky</span>, the other half of 2ETN and her other half.</p>
        <p>Her jewelry is couture meets rustic. Her work has been featured in numerous fashion publications, including <em>W</em>, <em>Elle Accessories, Nylon </em>and <em>Vibe</em>. It is more than a pleasure to have her featured in the Sac Issue of amfm. It is even more of a pleasure to have had the opportunity to get to know her as a designer and a friend.</p>
        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Why do you seek to redefine the concept of precious jewelry and how do you do this?</p>
        <p><strong>2ETN:</strong> There are a whole lot of lobbyists and ad agencies and PR firms that have been telling us over the years what a symbol of marriage, luxury and beauty “should” be. We are much more attracted to the idea of art and true sentiment. When we began creating jewelry we also were studying about the negative effects that the jewelry industry has on culture (especially indigenous people) and the environment and did not want to be a part of that.  <br />
        </p>
        <p>It was from that education that 2ETN was born: seeing imagery, as the focal point in jewelry and seeing value in that. The fact that over 20 tons of waste are created to make one gold ring and that lives are lost to mine a diamond were facts that we could not overlook. So we responded to that “problem” by creating a line of jewelry that ignores those demands and responds to like-minded people that want a piece of jewelry that is one-of-a-kind, created by a few artisans with all materials sourced ethically. </p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/2etn/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote1" width="300" height="238" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />amfm: </strong>How does nature influence your work? How do you use nature and history as a guide?<br />
           <br />
  <strong>2ETN: </strong>Nature has such an elegance about it and everything has a purpose—solid, grounding and never frivolous. In most jewelry and in fashion, there are trends. We try to find a certain permanence in our work by looking at the quiet, deeply rooted tree or the immense ocean or the stillness of a lake. We have a certain reverence for history and nature, as we see what has come to pass as a way of learning and being educated. </p>
        <p>2ETN is not interested in our present celebrity culture, but interested in those that came before us, that helped created the present. We reference many etchings, drawings, painting of nature that were created prior to photography, because our work contains images that Ed draws or paints and there is a certain richness to imagery that comes directly from nature and not a photograph.<br />
           <br />
  <strong> amfm:</strong> What is the 2ETN philosophy?<br />
  <strong> <br />
    2ETN: </strong>That we do for “work” and how we live our lives are one. Finding that balance between what we do for a living, how we live and who we are. They are all connected. The lines are magically blurred. Work (2ETN), family, friendships, gardening, exploring, etc., all tell the same story of interconnectedness and respect for each other and the environment.</p>
        <p>Finding balance and quality of life through love, respect and work. We also believe that precious stones and metals are not the sole element from which jewelry derives its value. This belief and deep interest and respect of Native American culture informs the philosophy behind our jewelry.</p>
        <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/byrd/2etn1.jpg" alt="2etn1" width="458" height="425" align="right" />amfm:</strong> How do you and Ed’s work complement each other? Do you work together? Influence each other?  What is the process of making a piece?<br />
           <br />
  <strong>2ETN:</strong> We create a (very) limited amount of jewelry..maybe three pieces a month on average. I design the jewelry, making sure that Ed has a space or a “frame” like area where he can paint or draw an image. We then work together and begin creating by either being inspired by an image, a story or a piece of jewelry that we have found. If it is a found/collected piece of jewelry we see what image fits best and then begin to create a “canvas” for that piece, sometimes using reclaimed wood, or bone.<br />
           <br />
          If an image or story inspires us or we are creating a custom piece of jewelry, we create the frame out of metal that best suits the image, this usually takes between 7-12 days and then we add the image. When the piece is a necklace or a bracelet there is more design work in creating the stone and crystal work to go with the piece. This process usually takes two to eight weeks from start to finish and a bit longer if someone wants us to create a custom piece using a vintage piece of jewelry that they supply.</p>
        <p>Ed is responsible for creating the imagery on all work. I am responsible for designing all of the jewelry; however, every step of this journey is done together. We check in on each other every step of the way, including packaging, outreach, web design, etc. It is truly a collaborative process.        </p>
