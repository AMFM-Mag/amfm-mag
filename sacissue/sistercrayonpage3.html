  <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/terra.jpg" alt="terra" width="296" height="296" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />amfm: </strong>How do you guys feel about being approached to do commercial things like working with Urban Outfitters and having your music featured on <em>The Real L Word?</em></p>
  <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I think that it's an interesting time in music because bigger corporations and TV channels are using more indie bands than ever before. 10 years ago-this wasn't happening, so it's really cool to be able to hear Sigur Ros on a car commercial or Grizzly Bear on a TV show, you know? </p>
          <p>We are not opposed at all to doing anything commercial as long as we are not forced to represent the band in a way that is not real or natural. We would never want to have our music be used in a product that we don't believe in or in a cause that we are not for of course, but as for shows like The Real L Word, we are just grateful for their support and we want to support them. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani: </strong>Good. Excited to just get our music out there. I was curious to see what other people outside of Sacramento people thought.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Why do you feel it’s important to experiment with music?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I believe that you have to experiment with music as an artist in order to find your true sound, your voice. I think it takes yearsor maybe a lifetime for an artist to truly hone in on their craft, so I think you should constantly be learning. The only way to truly learn is to make mistakes, to experiment on all levels. I know that every member in this band has been in different bands with different genres and I think we all learned so much from doing that. I think as an artist, you should never stop experimenting because that is where growth comes in. We still have so much shit that we want to do, to create, and to mess with. That is what makes this whole experience interesting. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> You will always surprise yourself. It's a fascinating thing</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/dani.jpg" alt="dani" width="341" height="221" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />amfm:</strong> How did you each individually get into music? </p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> Music has always fascinated me. I remember first hearing Elvis and Patsy Cline when I was little and how exciting and strange it was to me. I wanted to do what they were doing, even though I had no idea what it was. I would do the usual thing that probably every kid does, sing in my room to my stuffed animals to 50's music, pretending I was Elvis. I didn't really ever think that the possibility was real for me to become a musician though until I was in high school. I joined my first band and just never stopped. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> My father is a musician. I grew up around music. I started playing percussion when I was six years old. Music has always been my passion ever since. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Who are you most influenced by as a band and as an individual musically?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I think as a band I would say that we are all collectively influenced by experimenting—by playing random new instruments, by recording in the studio, by that type of stuff. There is nothing more exciting to us than being in the studio and geeking out over electronics, over sounds, and over tones. </p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/jeff.jpg" alt="jeff" width="304" height="312" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></strong>Musically, I would say that we all appreciate Radiohead (of course), Portishead, Bjork, Jon Brion,-the list goes on. I personally am influenced by my mother, Jeff Buckley, Maria Callas, Elvis, and quite recently, Charles Bradley. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> I feel like we are all influenced by our friends who are hard working musicians.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What’s your favorite place in Sac? What’s your favorite place to perform?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra: </strong>Hmm...I love a lot of places in Sacramento but my favorite venue is Luigi's FunGarden. We play all of our Sacramento shows there because they treat us well and the vibe is just fun. People go there to have a good time and to let loose and that they do. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> I would have to say Luigis for sure! I always have the best time there. It's honestly the only real all ages in Sacramento. I respect that. That particular venue has always been a big supporter of Sister Crayon.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> What’s your current obsession?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra: </strong>Oh geez, the band always makes fun of me for this because I'm the type of person who does get obsessed with things, people, etc, and play things out entirely way too fast because of this character trait. I guess, at the moment I am obsessed with Charles Bradley and Nina Simone. I am so enthralled by their voices and by their passion. Ah! It's exciting just to listen to them in my room and study them. It's basically all that I'm doing right now. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> Writing music in my room. I can do that all day. </p>
