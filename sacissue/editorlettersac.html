          <p><span class="style4">T</span>his Sacramento Issue of amfm is very near and dear to my heart. It is a culmination of my two years living, playing, working, learning and growing in the city. </p>
          <p>One fateful day in  Caesar Chavez Park in downtown Sacramento I met two girls who would forever change my world, open my world, and expose me to the wonder and talent that is Sacramento. I met them when I went to see Sister Crayon, who is the Artist of the Issue, perform along side Sea of Bees, and The New Humans, all staples of Sacramento, and all featured in this issue.</p>
          <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/sac issue/editorpic.jpg" alt="editorpic" width="262" height="393" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></span>They and Sacramento welcomed me, a stranger, with open arms, and I was able to get to know some of the amazing people that make Sacramento a great place to live, create, dream and follow your dreams. All of the people featured in this issue are doing just that, taking their dreams and turning them into reality. It was an inspiring place to inhabit.</p>
          <p>The city is deeply rooted in the art scene, with Second Saturday art walks every month, and with musicians sprouting like the many trees that line the streets. Paving the way for people like Olivia Coleho and Trisha Rhomberg, owners of the Bows and Arrows Collective, to take spaces and open storefronts, for people like Sister Crayon who began as one woman bedroom project and evolved into a band who has played along side Little Dragon, and The Album Leaf. </p>
          <p>Here you find artists pushing the boundaries of every day life in Sacramento, like Matthew David Byrd who has a vision almost as big (if not bigger) than the 100 pound whisk he created for House Restaurant. He combines his love for people, painting and welding into one.</p>
          <p>Or people like Raoul Ortega who has photographed most of the people and places in Sacramento that help put it on the musical map, or Pamela Tuohy of 2ETN who strive to create her beautiful vintage jewelry pieces with a conscience. </p>
          <p>This issue has been a long time coming, much anticipated and very trying. I am happy to finally release the Sac Issue, an homage to a great city, great friends, and a great time in my life that I will never forget. The rest is history in the pages of my memory and the pages before you on the screen. </p>
          <p>Enjoy!</p>
          <p>-Ciera </p>
