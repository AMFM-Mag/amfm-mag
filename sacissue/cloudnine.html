      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/cloudnine/photo2.jpg" alt="photo2" width="490" height="326" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /><span class="style4">T</span>hey say the clothes make man, well if the clothes make the man then Daniel Day is a man on cloud nine. And he isn’t coming down anytime soon. </p>
        <p>Day, co-founder and designer of the urban clothing line Cloud Nine, once said that if he wasn’t a millionaire by the time he’s 26, then he has failed. </p>
        <p>Day is 24 years old now with ample time left to strive to for millions, but for him it isn’t about the money, it’s about implementing a hard work ethic, the type of hard work that leads to millions.</p>
        <p>“Some people might say that the goal is shallow. But I don't know one person who doesn't want to be a millionaire,” Day said. </p>
        <p>“Now don't get me wrong money is not the most important thing to everybody, being happy and being healthy is, and should be, what makes me happy is making other people happy,” he said. </p>
        <p>In fact, that’s why he named his line Cloud Nine, which he says is a reflection of how he and his crew feel someone should live their life, “to the fullest” and to strive to do something you love and be happy doing it. </p>
        <p>For Day making people happy starts from the seams. He describes Cloud Nine as more of a collective than a clothing line. It’s composed of six designers who all bring a different element to the designing table, be it from concepts to photography. </p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/cloudnine/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="300" height="191" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />Each person is a part of the process from start to finish. Cloud Nine prides itself in the fact that they handle all aspects of the trade.</p>
        <p>“We are a direct reflection of the clothes we make,” Day said. “We do everything — the designs, the screen printing and embroidery, the distribution, sales, the photography and the marketing. We feel it's very important to handle every step of the process to ensure originality and quality,” he said.</p>
        <p>Cloud Nine is very California — laid back. One of their designs even says “With love from California.” The styles and colors of the graphic tees, hats and sweatshirts change with the season. Summer is bursting with color, reds, purple, bright blues and tie dye, while fall and winter have more earth tones with green an brown. <img src="../images/sac issue/cloudnine/photo1.jpg" alt="photo1" width="235" height="352" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
        <p>“Life inspires our designs. Where we grew up, what we have seen growing up and what we want our future to look like are all part of the concept process for creating a line, along with our emotions at the time. If we are in a good place or a bad place mentally it all plays a part in the design process,” Day said. </p>
        <p>Cloud Nine  seems to be in a pretty good place right now. </p>
        <p>When he started his clothing line in high school selling t-shirts out of his trunk, little did Day know that one t-shirt design would lead to having his clothes sold in stores throughout the Sacramento County, shipping clothes around the world to individuals, and ranking in the top five for PLNDR’s Battle of the Brands. Talk about trusting your hustle.</p>
        <p>“Back in high school I was tired of wearing what everybody else had. so I decided to make my own shirts to separate myself from everyone else. Some of my classmates wanted them, so I made 12 of one design, sold them all, made 12 of another design, sold them all, and basically just kept doing that until I graduated,” Day said. </p>
        <p>“It's funny that the reason I started making them was to have something that no one else had, and it turned into me selling them to other people,” he said.        </p>
