        <p class="style4">AN A+ FOR C PLUS</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><br />
          <span class="style4"><img src="../images/sac issue/cplus/cpluspic.jpg" alt="cplus" width="283" height="420" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />If</span> there were rap report cards, Chaz Wheeler aka C Plus, would get all A’s. A pluses. Fans on the west definitely have something to be excited about, especially in Sacramento, his humble hometown. </p>
          <p>In his song off of his debut album ALL C.I.T.Y. “Do What You Want (Gone)” Wheeler raps about how he “can’t leave Sac alone/the scene needs me.” Wheeler is a big part of the hip hop scene in Sacramento, and for him to leave it would be a huge loss. </p>
          <p>The 24 year old MC has lived in Sacramento his whole life, and has been rapping here since high school. He admits he can’t help but strive for bigger and better things. </p>
          <p>“It's cool to be a staple in the local scene, but it's more scary than anything because I get afraid I'm going to hit a ceiling, if I haven't already. You can only do so much at home. How can you help your city if you've never left your city?” Wheeler said. </p>
          <p>Which is why whenever he gets the opportunity to travel and do shows or promote his music he jumps on the chance, like he did for his “ALL C.I.T.Y” video which was shot in New York, the “big city of dreams.” In the beginning of the video he says “they say if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere. Just the fact that I made it here is kind of a big statement.” </p>
          <p>He reps his town “Black and Purple,” style, showing what Sac has to offer. “I'm trying to go to other places and set a good example and leave a good impression of what Sacramento is like because I was born and raised here. I guess I just don't want to get comfortable with being big at home,” he said.</p>
          <p><img src="../images/sac issue/cplus/pullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="247" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />Wheeler believes the Sacramento scene is thriving. He said there is a endless well of talent, the only thing he finds disheartening about it is that it seems to never leave the comfort of Sacramento. In a city where people are more settled in their lives he said the city has more a mellow vibe compared to it’s neighboring meccas San Francisco and Los Angeles. </p>
          <p>“I hear a lot of people hate on Sac. I've even heard it called &quot;the place where dreams go to die. I don't think dreams come here to die,” he said. </p>
          <p>In fact one could say Sacramento is where dreams are born if you look at all of the emerging talent coming from the state capital. </p>
          <p> Wheeler has been rapping since he was a 13 year old in science class who started to flow on a dare. He said he always liked to write and that it came easily to him, but he was surprised by how natural it was for him to pick up cadence and rhythm.</p>
          <p>He signed up for the school talent show as one of two hip hop acts, and from then on he hasn’t left the stage. </p>
          <p>“Rapping gave me a sense of identity. It was my niche, it's what gave me my swagger, and character. It helped me grow up,” Wheeler said. <br />
          </p>
          <p>“I always skateboarded, was into writing, fashion, and different shit, but I never found ‘my thing’ until I started doing music. It's my only outlet, passion, and hobby that I still find enjoyment in at this point in my life,” he said.</p>
          <p>Wheeler said he’s inspired the everyday life, experiences, art and culture of growing up in Natomas. He was heavily influenced by '90s culture and music like 2 Pac, Biggie, Smashing Pumpkins, REM and even Bush. “Remember Bush? I f*cked with them tough,” he said. <img src="../images/sac issue/cplus/cplusperforming.jpg" alt="performance" width="269" height="414" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
          <p>He said he also touches a lot on his 20's because he feels like his generation is special, being the last generation to grow up with “hands on training,” rather than growing up with the luxury of the internet at their fingertips —“internet babies” he calls them. Having grown up in a different time and being slightly older, he feels like he can bring a different element to the table for the youth of today. &quot;Each one, teach one&quot; is his motto.</p>
          <p>“19 to 25 is so crucial to your development as a person and the rest of your life. I feel like my music is the sound track to that right now. I only hope I can still be making people’s life soundtracks when I'm 30,” he said.</p>
          <p>Wheeler said he doesn’t want to be a role model though. He may rap a lot about weed, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t strive to set a good example.  He also raps about striving to make it and doing what you want and what makes you happy.</p>
          <p>He said he just tries to keep it as real as possible with his audience. He just wants to make music that people can feel and he said he is all about bettering the quality of life for his loved ones and himself.  “Times are hard. Sacrifices have to be made. Risks have to be taken,” he said. </p>
          <p>“I am doing what I want to be doing. I just want to do it on a much more massive level. I want the world. Period. I wanna be as big as Kanye, Wayne, and Jay, then be able to go on MTV and be like, Yea, I'm from Sacramento. It's the best place EVER.”</p>
