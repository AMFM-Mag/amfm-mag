      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4">B</span>ows and Arrows Collective is an inspiration station, at least that’s what owners Trisha Rhomberg and Olivia Coelho want it to be. </p>
        <p>What formerly began as a vintage shop in the heart of Sacramento’s Midtown, has expanded its services to  serving food and spirits in their Fat Face run cafe. It also operates as a gallery and venue for artists and musicians.</p>
        <p>They have always been a part of further building a foundation of the Sacramento arts, music and fashion scene. They used to have art and music shows in their shop on L street, and both Rhomberg and Coelho are artists, sew and make their own jewelry. </p>
        <p>“Olivia and I came up with the idea to expand Bows into a collective when we noticed the lack of emerging artists spaces in Midtown,” Rhomberg said. “So many people came to the Second Saturday art openings and live music shows we had at the shop, and we felt like music and art needed a more respectable venue to be enjoyed in,” she said.<img src="../images/sac issue/bows/jewls.jpg" alt="jewls" width="215" height="229" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /></p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/bows/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote1" width="219" height="131" hspace="5" align="right" />Their new space is exactly that. They took a terrifying leap of faith, invested their money in a vision and completely renovated the new Bows on S street. They said the amount of set backs and worries were tremendous with city and state codes that came with the restaurant, liquor license, and entertainment.</p>
        <p>“It was a trial in resilience and determination,” Rhomberg said. “We are the get shit done girls,” she said.</p>
        <p>Rhomberg and Coelho met at Sellout Buyout, an art and trade show for designers in Sacramento. The two like-minded individuals connected right off the bat and Coelho began selling pieces from Rhomberg’s line Pretty Trashy in her old shop OLIPOM, which closed down after a fire. Both having had successful businesses, they teamed up to head Bows and Arrows, a buy sell trade store on a larger scale. <br />
        </p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/bows/prescription.jpg" alt="prescription" width="219" height="311" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />Bows carries all sorts of odds and ends. Clothing, re-designed clothing, shoes, jewelry, records, vintage sunglasses, trinkets, typewriters, and art. Rhomberg said they choose items that they love, would wear, have worn, and items from unique local designers.</p>
        <p>“We wanted to build a viable business that could support the local art scene, and just expand upon our interest in special things— special clothing, special jewelry, special experiences, special beer. Everything is hand selected for its unique characteristics,” Rhomberg said. </p>
        <p>“We want to put money in the pockets of artists and musicians. We want to be supportive, it’s what will help join the art and business worlds,” she said. </p>
        <p>Coelho and Rhomberg are a perfect example of the melding of the art and business worlds, they know both worlds intimately and what they need to thrive. </p>
        <p>Rhomberg’s even has this whole philosophy on what an art needs to thrive, “A Prescription for a Healthy Arts Scene,” written by Renny Pritikin, which she says is the most inspirational thing she’s ever read. They based an exhibit on the philosophy where 20 artists were asked to create t-shirts based on the philosophy. </p>
        <p> It includes 24 facets that every art scene should have like, alternative spaces that give exhibition and commissioning space for new art and artists, hangouts/parties/salons/lecture series/restaurants/bars where a sense of community is manifested, and events that bring people together (scheduled multi-gallery opening nights for example). </p>
