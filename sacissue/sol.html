      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/sac issue/sol/solcollective.jpg" alt="solcollective" width="446" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />A </span>combination of activism and arts is the heart and soul of Sacramento’s community arts center Sol Collective.</p>
        <p> What began as a master thesis project for founder Estella Sanchez to bring together community members to implement services and support for Sacramento’s youth evolved into something far grandeur in 2003.</p>
        <p>The space is completely run by the community, educators, and volunteers with a mission “to use art, education, and technology as a didactic medium to create mobilization and community empowerment,” according to their website. </p>
        <p> “Much of our programming comes directly from community members,” Sanchez said. </p>
        <p>It was the community that reached out to Sol Collective when a devastating fire in 2008 destroyed the space and almost its entire mission. </p>
        <p>“The fire really brought set back all our efforts,” Sanchez said. “If it wasn't for the support in the community and the requests from the community to re-open it may have never happened.”</p>
        <p>Sol Collective was able to re-open its doors in 2010 in a new space with a new outlook and fresh ideas to continue to serve the community. </p>
        <p>Sanchez said Sol strives to create a space that is accessible to all members of the community by providing diverse opportunities to engage in the arts.<img src="../images/sac issue/sol/kids.jpg" alt="kids" width="378" height="248" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /></p>
        <p>“Sol Collective has a vibrant art scene,” Sanchez said. </p>
        <p>It is a vital part of the Sacramento scene, hosting art shows, all ages music events, film screenings, workshops and lectures and promotes a positive vibe within and outside of its realms.</p>
        <p>Sol offers a number of events, classes and workshops for youth. They are teamed up with local schools ranging from junior high to college level to offer programs like the Sac Activist School, music and video production, graphic design, and they even offer internships. </p>
        <p>“The majority of our leadership are educators so working with young people is important to the organization, especially when we are thinking of long term community development,” Sanchez said. “We want to provide a space for young people to be exposed to the arts,” she said. </p>
        <p>Sanchez believes that art, music and culture are important tools for education.<img src="../images/sac issue/sol/pullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="229" height="370" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
        <p>“Most of our art shows have socio-cultural themes that address a variety of issues,” she said. Issues like social equality, access to education, food access in low-income communities, cultural activism, and immigration rights.</p>
        <p>They actually prefer to feature art and artists that has a socio-political or cultural tone and seek to cross areas of art, culture and activism. These themes are known to break boundaries, open minds, and raise awareness on issues that affect humanity.</p>
        <p>“Music and art are part of every culture, and social justice is an effort within communities to ensure all members are treated with respect and equality,” Sanchez said. “Issues such as clean water, and the environment affect all cultures, and music and art give us tools to communicate such issues in a cross-cultural way,” she said.</p>
        <p>Sanchez believes that images and sounds are universal and they can convey more information without necessarily using one specific language.</p>
        <p>The people that go to Sol Collective are definitely an eclectic crowd. It is a melting pot of ideas, cultures, causes and art forms. You can go and see a film about Human Trafficking one day, see an art show, go to a record swap or open mic another, and dance to global beats on the weekend. </p>
        <p>“Our music events such as the Global Hood Music series bring artists from all over the world to share their music, culture and experience,” Sanchez said. “The series offers the opportunity for a cultural exchange and our hope is that we help further develop a fan base for international artists in our city to ensure that we remain on the touring circuit in the future,” she said.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/sol/art3.jpg" alt="art3" width="359" height="256" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />Sol has brought in acts like Grammy award winning Chilean female rapper, Ana Tijoux, Columbia’s Bomba Estereo, the  duo Los Rakas who grew up in Panama, and they hosted the first International Hip Hop Festival. </p>
        <p>For their sixth anniversary party along with great music, there was even better art. When Sol isn’t serving the community, they are an ever changing gallery space. Each wall was painted with murals by different artists spanning from the ceiling to the floor. The walls spoke volumes. </p>
        <p>Sanchez said since the original site they now let artists take over the space and have them paint directly on the walls and when the exhibit ends the walls are painted over to return them to a blank state for the next artist to transform. </p>
        <p>Sol Collective is the first of it’s kind in Sacramento to focus on the hybridity of art forms one space. They continue to evolve like the art on their walls, the music on their speakers, and the soul in their collective.</p>
