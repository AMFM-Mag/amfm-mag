        <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How are Sacramento fans different from fans from other cities?</p>
<p><strong>Terra:</strong> The energy that Sacramento fans bring to a show is just incredible. I mean, it's something I can't quite explain without feeling overwhelmed or emotional even. The support here has been something that I never thought was possible.</p>
<p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote2" width="300" height="300" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" /></strong>People here want to see you succeed, they want to be a part of it. Bigger cities tend to have some strange competitiveness between everyone. For the most part, Sacramento people are different. They want encourage and support you. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> Sacramento fans are crazy. I love them all. They have shown Sister Crayon endless support since day one. I respect all of our fans.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How did you come up with the name Sister Crayon? What does it mean?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I was going solo at the time and was going under a more somber name and I just decided one day that I wanted to create something different and with that, create an alter-ego of sorts. Sister Crayon became that alter-ego for me. I thought that since the name was a bit more aggressive, maybe it would force me to be in a way.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> Your band has evolved over time with bandmates, losing keyboardist Genaro, gaining guitarist Jeff, and now losing your drummer Nick, how have you adapted and embraced these changes? Have they affected your music style at all? The band?</p>
<p><strong>Terra:</strong> I've always seen Sister Crayon as an evolving entity of sorts. When I first started it, I had no idea that it would even become a full band, to be honest. It was just me recording bedroom songs, and then over time, I met individuals who clicked and it became a band. I see this project as something that is constantly evolving.</p>
          <p>I think that with the addition of Jeff and the loss of Nick that the band is just evolving into what it is meant to become. I don't know quite how to explain it, but the music that we have made (whether it was solo or a band) has always been based on mood more so than anything else. I think that is how we know when a member is right or not—if they get that or if they don't. We are still evolving as a band and I feel we are just at the beginning of creating what we are supposed to. I feel like we have barely scratched the surface. </p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/bellow.jpg" alt="bellow" width="301" height="297" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />Dani: </strong>I believe changes are good if they are best for the success of the band. I honestly believe it makes us stronger as musicians and individuals. We are moving forward and in the process of writing and developing our next album. Nothing will stop us. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm:</strong> How has the release of Bellow been received? What does this album mean to you? What does bellow mean? What exactly are you bellowing?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> Our first record has been received really well actually. We appreciate all of the support. It's amazing to us. People will come up to us and tell us what the album means to them and it's so great that people can get something out of these songs. </p>
          <p>The album to me, is a very vulnerable, innocent debut album. When we went into the studio to record these songs, we didn't have a record label or anything like that. We just went into the studio because we believed in the songs and we wanted them to be recorded. So when I listen back to the album, it just brings me to that time in the studio, the not knowing what these songs would become, if anything. </p>
          <p>The word Bellow to me is just simply an emotion. A really sad, long, exhausting feeling that has been there all my life. When I play these songs live it's a relief to me.</p>
          <p><strong>Dani:</strong> The album is doing great! People really seem to enjoy it. This album will always mean the most to me because it's my first. I have great memories that come from that album.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Terra, you started off Sister crayon as a solo act, why did you decide to bring on band members? how did you and Dani team up and eventually form a band together?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I started a solo project because I wanted to create very personal music without having to worry about explaining lyrics to other band members, without worrying about whether or not someone else liked or disliked the song, etc. I wanted to be able to create freely so I formed &quot;Silent and Clementine&quot; which was what the project was originally named. </p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/terradani.jpg" alt="terradani" width="424" height="329" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" /></strong>After about half a year of performing under that name, I decided that I wanted to create more &quot;intense&quot; music. I felt that the quiet,bedroom music that I was making did not reflect the way that I was feeling so I opted for the name &quot;Sister Crayon&quot; because I felt thatname was a &quot;tougher&quot; alter-ego. I guess I just wanted something bolder, in the hopes that it would allow me to perform bolder andget out of my shell.</p>
          <p>About a year later, I met Dani through her sister and we just clicked. We quickly started writing together (she played insane hand percussion) which quickly transcended to MPC work. We've been inseparable ever since. The band just evolved naturally. We never scouted out members or anything. The members found the band themselves, which was nice. As the fan base started to grow, we just kept on practicing and playing more, and eventually Sister Crayon grew into a four piece. I like to think fate worked its way into the mix to find Genaro and Jeffrey. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>How did signing with Warpaint’s Manimal label in 2009 change things for Sister Crayon?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> Man, Manimal was the first label to give us a chance. I remember sending the five song EP that we had recorded to them and one other label not really thinking anything of it. The next day, Paul (the owner of Manimal) called me and said that he wanted to sign us. I just remember freaking out silently. I immediately called the guys and we all freaked out. It was such a great experience.</p>
          <p>Manimal has been amazing to us. They believe in our music, and they have introduced us to so many beautiful and amazing artists and people. They are family. We really appreciate all that they have done for us and still continue to do for us. They helped push Sister Crayon out into the world and that means so much to us. </p>
<p><strong>Dani:</strong> It changed a lot of things. We never saw it coming. We were always fans of the Manimal family. Bat For Lashes was one of my favorites at the time. We instantly got more exposure. Signing to Manimal definitely opened a lot of doors for us.</p>
