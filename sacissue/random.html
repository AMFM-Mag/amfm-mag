        <p class="style4">NOT SO RANDOM</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><span class="style4">R</span>andom Abiladeze is not just your random guy, nor is he just some random rapper. He calls himself the Rumplestitlzkin of hip-hop. And hip-hop is even far too narrow of a description—he’s a genre-bending, spoken word, rapper, word prophet with a little but of funny and a dash of blues. <img src="../images/sac issue/random/randommic.jpg" alt="random" width="488" height="326" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
          <p>“Random Abiladeze is a play on my real name [Randy],” Abiladeze said. </p>
          <p>“The significance of my name is in my personality and my body of work, that transcends hip-hop and poetry. I’ve included blues, comedy, public speaking, writing, and many other creative aspects. People that follow my performances are held in suspense as to what I’ll do. I deepen the meaning of my name every time I expand on my repertoire,” he said.</p>
          <p>If you go to a Random Abiladeze show expect to see a an eclectic mix of Randy’s abilities. He raps with a DJ, plays with his own band, gives life lessons and you can never quite tell if he’s being facetious or sarcastic. He’s quite a witty fellow. </p>
          <p>You can tell by his album titles. </p>
          <p>His debut, “Brutally Honest,” was exactly as the title called for. </p>
          <p>“Indubitably,” his most recent, and possibly last solo album for a while, he said is “an amalgamation of my metaphysical, romantic, philosophical, religious, musical, business, racial, historical beliefs.”</p>
          <p><img src="../images/sac issue/random/pullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="289" height="198" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />“Skill Before Swagger,” an entire album he did by email had a big message, yet simple. He said the entire album was a bout minimalism and poignancy. </p>
          <p>“I’m not condemning swagger as a whole, I just feel that skill should be your foundation, that’s why it’s before swagger,” Abiladeze said.</p>
          <p> “Cab Calloway, Sam Cooke, Paul Robeson, Little Richard, James Brown, Muhammad Ali, Muddy Waters, Harry Belafonte, B.B. King, Redd Foxx, Richard Pryor, Sammy Davis Jr, Billie Holiday, Etta Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Ray Charles, Jackie Wilson….ALL HAD SWAGGER! The big “but” is that they were all very skilled, so they could get away with it. In fact, they used their swag to accentuate their legitimate talent and skill.  We’ve come to a time in life where there’s more focus on swagger than skill or talent,” he said. </p>
          <p>And that’s where a great line from &quot;Kitchen Raps&quot; comes in, “Due to marketing these kids is gettin bigger than me/ but my style versus theirs is like graffiti versus calligraphy.”</p>
          <p>Random is rap calligraphy, and a lot of that might have to do with his spoken word background. He started off as a rapper in high school,  but it wasn’t until later that he decided to dabble a bit more with poetry. </p>
          <p>“The realm of spoken word that I encountered was heavily based on turning your work into performance pieces, so it helped cultivate my stage show as an emcee. It also helped me to appreciate pauses and diction,” he said.</p>
          <p>Perhaps he picked up on his pauses and diction from his favorite comedians and learning how to deliver a good punch line. <img src="../images/sac issue/random/randomrap.jpg" alt="rapping" width="269" height="401" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /></p>
          <p>“I probably listened to more Bill Cosby records than music between the ages 7-10. Comedy plays just as big a role in my life as music, if not more,” Abiladeze said.</p>
          <p>“Comedy is by far the rawest, most open form of expression. You can literally do whatever you want and have it considered comedy. The line is very blurred between comedy and poetry. I've gotten so many life lessons from the best comics,” he said. </p>
          <p>“Randy” says he was both the class clown, and he laughed at those who clowned in class. His creativity fused by being an only child allowed for a lot character creation, and introspection. </p>
          <p>He grew up in predominantly White and Latino community, with older parents, which he says heavily influence and inspire his music. He said he often just lets the music tell him what he’s going to rap about. </p>
          <p>He’s inspired by many great lyricists and MC’s, but music with singing and traditional music are what inspire him the most. He said the Quincy Jones “Back on the Block” album changed his life. His ever-changing life.</p>
          <p>“I’m moved and inspired by love. I am moved and inspired by the honesty of children. I am moved and inspired by parents, especially single parents who do their best to make life work for their kids. I am inspired by talented artists who express from their heart and anyone who is just as authentic as they can be, moving towards positive outcomes,” he said. </p>
          <p><img src="../images/sac issue/random/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote2" width="247" height="168" align="left" />Random is his authentic self at all times, except when he’s one of his rap personas, but he said he tries to push and break boundaries with his music by simply being himself. He said there is no one exactly like him. There is no one exactly like you, or the next person. And this “self” is all but an illusion. </p>
          <p>“What I am changes. It’s all moving. It’s all an illusion and then we’re gone. Or are we?” he said.</p>
          <p>It’s been said that he’s retiring from rapping, but a sabbatical would be more appropriate. Is Indubitably really his last album? Is Random really gone from the Sac scene? Is he really done rapping? </p>
          <p>“There’s a quote from a rare book called All That You Are by an author under the pseudonym Mary that says: Once a truth is realized, further ‘study’ becomes superfluous and Great Intelligence does nothing which is unnecessary,” Abiladeze said.</p>
          <p>“That’s why I am not officially announcing retirement. It never leaves you, just have to decide when you’re ready to turn off certain valves and make room for different methods of pouring one’s self into life,” he said. </p>
          <p>Indubitably said.        </p>
