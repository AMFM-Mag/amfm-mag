      <p><span class="style4"><img src="../images/sac issue/bows/bowsinterior.jpg" alt="bowsinterior" width="395" height="289" hspace="10" vspace="0" align="right" /></span>The new Bows Collective is following this philosophy quite well, they bring all of these things to the Sacramento arts scene.</p>
      <p>They try to have at least three live music shows a month, like the Appetite record release show  and a new art opening every first Friday of the month, and of course events for Second Saturdays put on by their art show curator and marketing director Richard St. Olfe. </p>
      <p>They even have a bathroom art series consisting of wall art that changes frequently. “We want to use every inch of space to showcase great new local art,” Rhomberg said.</p>
      <p>Especially in a place like Sacramento where the creativity is ubiquitous and artists, musicians and thinkers are budding every where. <br />
        </p>
      <p>“I want it to be a comfortable place where people come to feel inspired, and talk about what is happening now, and things we can do to change what is not working with our community, and take physical steps in making the scene more healthy and viable,” Rhomberg said. </p>
      <p>Both wanted Bows to have the comfort of their own homes with great art, great music, great food and beverages, in a warm atmosphere. </p>
      <p>There are couches, and rich colors on the interior, deep violets and mustard and accents of wood which touches on their love of nature and craftsmanship. <img src="../images/sac issue/bows/patio.jpg" alt="patio" width="355" height="248" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /></p>
      <p>Their patio is one of the best in the city, completely surrounded by plants and greenery, the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine and a sandwich on a sunny afternoon. </p>
      <p>It’s the kind of place where people can just come and hangout. They too are trying to thrive like the art scene. Their monthly events are always a hit and well attended, but the prescription for a healthy small business would be daily traffic.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think people realize how important and how much of an impact it is to come in one day and just buy a pair of earrings or a beer. That is the kind of commerce that can make or break a small business,” Rhomberg said. </p>
      <p>Especially given their plans to expand. Rhomberg believes it is important to expand further, always. To improve, to offer something new, and provide better services. “We are both really driven, but there are only so many hours in a day,” she said. </p>
