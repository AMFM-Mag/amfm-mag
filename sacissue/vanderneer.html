      <blockquote>
        <p><span class="style4">F</span>airy tales aren’t just for kids anymore. They are also written on the runway. </p>
        <p>The Sacramento designers behind Van Der Neer are cutting, sewing and designing fairy tale worthy clothing each time they come out with a new collection. </p>
        <p>The couple, Nicole Kniss, 24, and 27 year old, Justin Johnson’s clothes are unlike anything you’ve ever seen. Each collection has a story behind it, whether it’s space, science fiction or vintage gold. </p>
        <p>“We see our clothes as part of a story, a story of past eras integrated with random inspirations of dreams, life, and future,” Kniss said. </p>
        <p>“You could say a piece has the feel of vintage but has the overall look of modern. Our clothes are for someone looking for a statement piece, for something that transforms them into another world of pure fantasy,” she said. </p>
        <p>Pure fantasy describes Van Der Neer perfectly. These aren’t typical clothes that you would see on a rack in a store. Where else could you find an jumpsuit that is half swimsuit, and half knit with an oversized knitted hood? In the minds of these two designers in Sacramento. <img src="../images/sac issue/vanderneer/hood.jpg" alt="hood" width="221" height="347" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" /></p>
        <p>For them, making clothing is an art form. Something that seems to have gotten lost in the mass produced world of fashion that we live in. Creating hand made clothes that are one of a kind are inspiration in itself. For the designers the purpose isn’t necessarily to make clothes that are “wearable,” but memorable.</p>
        <p>“Our philosophy is to bring people not only beautiful, glamorous clothes, but to do it while entertaining and telling a story,” Kniss said. “We just want the audience to leave feeling like they just saw something totally different and feel inspired,” she said. </p>
        <p>Van Der Neer is “stitching an era,” and what era it happens to be is not cut and dry. Kniss said their inspiration is constantly changing. She said they are inspired by any and everything, from vintage fabric and colors, to a movie, a song, or a picture. They strive to keep every inspiration relevant and tied to a time period.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/vanderneer/pullquote.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="242" height="273" hspace="20" vspace="10" align="right" />“Sometimes the inspiration starts with the show we want to have even before any clothes are made,” Kniss said.</p>
<p>For their show at the 2011 Launch Festival, a festival that showcases everything from art to fashion and architecture to design, their theme was “Gold Planet,” which was inspired by the future, space, science fiction and 70’s glam. </p>
        <p>“Our inspirations were in themselves on the wild side, so the clothes followed suit,” Kniss said. “You can't be inspired by David Bowie and space and turn around and make boring clothes, you have to live up to the nature of the inspiration,” she said. </p>
        <p>This is coming from a couple who dressed up as Beetlejuice and Lydia for Halloween. Their clothes are far from boring, and they are far from boring people. </p>
        <p>Neither have had formal design training— they are both self taught. They just had a knack for creating and Van Der Neer became the perfect outlet. </p>
        <p>Kniss said that after being together for eight years they are pretty in tune with each other’s designing aesthetics. She said they often unconsciously create the same styles and concepts.</p>
        <p>“We both work side by side inspiring and helping each other every step of the way. We try not to tell each other what to do or not do, but more advise and inspire,” Kniss said. “We try to fuel each other’s inspirations. We make the collections evenly and as a whole, splitting the outfits in half but at the same time making them together,” she said. </p>
        <p><img src="../images/sac issue/vanderneer/nicolejustin.jpg" alt="nicolejustin" width="409" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />Their future may be unwritten, but their story doesn’t end in Sacramento. The two designers hope to keep telling more stories and let their clothing speak in other cities and venues around the nation and aspire to show internationally as well. </p>
        <p>For them, Sacramento has been a great place to build their business and connect with other “artists and visionaries.” They have been a huge force in the Sacramento fashion arts scene with a level of entertainment on par with any concert or art opening. </p>
        <p>They believe their message is successful if people leave entertained. Kniss said they are not concerned about people understanding the clothes or theme, and then she quoted Freddy Mercury saying, &quot;Let me entertain you.&quot;</p>
        <p>And entertained you will be. A Van Der Neer fashion show is definitely a memorable experience. </p>
        <p>Right now they are busy working hard on their next collection, revamping their web site, and expanding their aspirations and inspirations. What happens next for Kniss and Johnson is an open book. </p>
        <p>“Everything is a fable and only our minds can create what happens in the future, these are the premises in which we believe. It is up to us to create the next myth or fable,” Johnson said.        </p>
