        <p class="style4">ARTIST OF THE ISSUE: SISTER CRAYON</p>
        <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
        <blockquote> <strong class="style4">Sister Crayon</strong> is Sacramento’s sweetheart. Quite possibly the most well-known and beloved band in the city. Their fans, many of them friends of the band, people they’ve grown up with, and people who have seen the band grow from Terra’s bedroom beginnings, to Dani and her drum machine, the Genaro days, the parting of Nick and the addition of Jeffrey and his mad guitar bowing skills.
<p><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/sistercrayonband.jpg" alt="sistercrayon" width="540" height="330" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" />None of this has stopped the band, if anything, it has given them more momentum. They released their first studio album <em>Bellow,</em> been featured in <em>Nylon</em>, and embarked on their first U.S. tour playing alongside The Album Leaf. The laundry list of accolades and growing popularity for the band hasn’t gone to their heads. </p>
          <p>They are some of the most humble people you will ever meet. Terra is quiet, but one would never think so when her voice booms on stage and haunts you when you leave. Dani is like seeing your best friend on stage kill it for the crowd and then going to get drunk on blueberry bombs at her favorite local bar after. Jeff is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. He gets in the zone when behind a computer mixing music and behind the strings of his guitar or the stove— he makes great pasta. </p>
          <p>Sister Crayon will forever hold a special place in the heart of California’s capital, and in mine as well. Check out our Q&amp;A with the band.</p><p><strong>amfm: </strong>How would you describe your music to someone who had never heard it?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I guess the best way that I could describe it to someone would just be to call it &quot;manic&quot; ...or something to the effect that it may not be pretty at times but it's real. </p>
          <p><strong>
            Dani:</strong> It's a mixture of different sounds but together. I don't like to label our music. We don't have a specific genre.</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote1" width="300" height="211" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="right" /></strong><strong>amfm:</strong> How have your Sacramento roots influenced your music and experience as artists?</p>
<p><strong>Terra:</strong> I believe that Sacramento has tremendously influenced our music because this city allows us the time to experiment, create, and hone our craft. I feel that this city has a great balance of just enough artists and outlets without being overwhelming, while having enough so that it's not limiting, you know? </p>
          <p>As I get older, I personally appreciate this city more and more. When I was younger, a teenager, I used to despise this place (just because I lived here my whole life), but the more we go out and tour I'm always so appreciative when we come back home. This city influences me in some way, whether through lyrics, creativity, or just the quiet space that it provides— I know that more and more everyday.</p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>You guys have been gaining a lot of momentum lately, doing your first national tour with the Album Leaf, accolades from major music outlets, how have you felt about this and been responding to it?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra: </strong>We honestly just work hard and want to stay focused. I mean, it's so great that people are responding to our music and we appreciate it so much, but there is still so much that we want to do. It's exciting though to see the fan base building. That's really all that we want, to be able to create music and share it with who ever will listen. We're so grateful for the support. It means so much to us. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani: </strong>Excited and very thankful. I feel very honored to have the opportunity to play with the Album Leaf. I never in my life imagined I would be where I'm at today with my music. I'm blessed. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>Have you learned anything on tour from other bands you performed with? Did you learn anything new/interesting about yourself? What’s the best advice you’ve been given or lesson you’ve learned?</p>
          <p><strong><img src="../images/sac issue/sistercrayon/tour.jpg" alt="tour" width="290" height="314" hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />Terra: </strong>I think we learn so much every time we are on tour, whether it's from other bands, different cities, fans, each other, etc. I know that I've learned a lot from just driving on the highways droning out to music,  and thinking. Jeff and I are the drivers so whenever I'm driving that is usually my time to assess the trip, write lyrics, think of the show before or the night of, etc. </p>
          <p>We've been fortunate to tour with great artists who have been so kind and giving so we have learned a lot from them as well, whether it be &quot;tour tips&quot; such as packing the van, what to bring, what venues to play, or just by watching them perform and learning. I love touring because we learn so much about us as a band and as individuals. We are so close to one another because of touring. </p>
          <p>Touring is a strange beast because you're vulnerable 100 percent of the time that you are out. I mean, you are never alone. You do practically everything together. It can pretty intense, but I love it because we have grown so close together and learned so much about each other because of touring. </p>
          <p><strong>amfm: </strong>What has been your most memorable performance? Where is the best place Sister Crayon has taken you?</p>
          <p><strong>Terra:</strong> I would have to say that so far our hometown shows have been the most memorable. I mean, the support here is insane and we are blown away every single time we play here. Every show over the last two years have been sold out and people come with such intense, raw energy—singing, screaming, dancing. It's amazing. There is nothing like it. </p>
          <p>Another great time we had was when we played in LA at a venue called Bardot. It felt like a hometown show because the energy of the crowd was so overwhelming. I feel that there are still so many places to play still so I'm just excited to perform more all over. </p>
          <p><strong>Dani: </strong>I was really excited to play with Little Dragon. The museum was absolutely incredible. But I honestly always love to play at Luigi’s. We never have a bad show there, and the crowd is insane. I always love to see my friends and family in audience as well. </p>
