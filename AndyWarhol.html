      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="content"><span class="style4">22</span> years after his death, comes an   exhibit that explores the final years of the man that introduced Pop   Art to the world, Andy Warhol. The Milwaukee Art Museum is the first   U.S. museum to showcase the late work of Warhol made just before his   death. When Warhol died in 1987, the world lost a great art and pop   culture icon. Despite his waning success in the late seventies, Warhol   made some of his most profound pieces in the eighties, especially in   the last two years that he was living.  <img src="images/Andy Warhol/frightwig.jpg" alt="fright wig" width="342" height="342" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /><br />

When Andy Warhol comes to mind we see vivid colors, Campbell's Soup   Cans, Coca-Cola, Marilyn Monroe, and consumerism in a modern light.   For decades we have asked ourselves, what art is, and whether or not   Warhol was a true artiste. Warhol was widely known for his use of everyday   objects as subjects in his pieces. His inspirations were his passions,   and he created what he liked. He liked coke, so he made the silk screen   &quot;Three Coke Bottles,&quot; and he liked it so much he did it again   with &quot;100 Bottles of Coke.&quot; Most of his art created in the   sixties and seventies were of that nature—brand names, newspaper headlines, celebrities and the like. <img src="images/Andy Warhol/pullquote1.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /></p>
        <p class="content">The Andy Warhol that comes to mind is not the Andy Warhol that created   some of his earlier and later pieces. Before there was silk screen,   and images of the mundane made extraordinary, there was paper and ink.   Warhol's humble beginnings were in drawing women's shoe advertisements   with ink. His earlier work is described as whimsical. Warhol's drawings   have a certain air about them, especially the blotted line technique   he was known for using. It illustrates the delicacy of his sketching   and the weightlessness of his hand. One wouldn’t even know the same   artist who was responsible for these shoe pieces was even remotely reminiscent   of the latter.  <br />
          <br />
        Throughout his success, Warhol dabbled in many different spheres, filmmaking,   publishing, and record producing, and doing portraits. He was also heavily   involved in the searching for new talent and fascinating people, and   is known for his Factory years—a space for intellectual, artsy, and   free thinking individuals to roam and do what they do best—produce art. Warhol mass produced his art in The Factory as though they were   consumer goods, after all they were in high demand. But Warhol never   made more pieces than those he made toward the end of his career. He   made more art in his final years than in his entire professional art   career.  <img src="images/Andy Warhol/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /><br />
          <br />
  <img src="images/Andy Warhol/warhol_basquiat_oxidation.jpg" alt="basquiat" width="327" height="299" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />Warhol shed the Pop Art persona and evolved toward new styles, techniques   and inspirations—one of his biggest being Jean-Michel Basquiat. Basquiat   inspired Warhol to return to painting. When the two met, there was an   instant artist's attraction, and this led to many collaborative pieces   from the two. According the book, <em>Jean-Michel   Basquiat</em>, Warhol and Basquiat made over 50 pieces together. Warhol   would begin by painting, and Basquiat, most known for his graffiti style   would layer over the painting with words or images. <br />
          <br />
        One of the influential pieces of Warhol's career was definitely his   Last Supper series using the imagery of Leonardo Da Vinci's original,   and ironically it just so happened to be his last. After being approached   by an Italian art dealer with the Last Supper series offer, Warhol accepted it  and the series turned out to be a piece very dear to the artist. Rather than   mass producing his art as quickly as possible, Warhol worked on this   series for over a year, delving himself into his work. This was Warhol   on a grandeur scale—his pieces had considerably grown in size, some   as long as entire walls. One of the largest pieces was Warhol's collaboration   with Basquiat on the Last Supper punching bag sculptures, &quot;Ten   Punching Bags (Last Supper).&quot; <img src="images/Andy Warhol/punchingbags.jpg" alt="punchingbags" width="360" height="216" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /><br />
          <br />
          Warhol created over 100 variations of the Last Supper theme. Some of   it was silk screen, while some of it was painted. The large focal point   was the image of Jesus, which was a growing motif in the series. Like   his Coca-Cola cans, Warhol made a silk screen with multiple pictures   of Jesus’ face. Others, were manipulated with color, camouflage, and   layering effects, representing Jesus from all angles with a signature   consumer flair like a piece with the GE and Dove logo, or another with   a motorcycle plastered across the Last Supper scene. <br />
          <br />
        Other works from this period include his eight piece Oxidation series,   which was another step away from his Pop Art influences. These pieces   were canvases primed with copper-based paint. The oxidation aspect is a process that occurs after urine stains the copper with its acidity. These pieces, although   odd in medium, created beautiful spots and colors on the canvas, each   varying in effect from person to person. Another includes his &quot;Fright   Wig&quot; series, done months before his death, which expose the many   personas of Warhol—the celebrity, icon, and artist.  <img src="images/Andy Warhol/lastsupper2.jpg" alt="lastsupper" width="373" height="257" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /><br />

<p class="content">The Last Supper series and also the &quot;Fright Wig,&quot; series,   which at times is haunting with Warhol's stoic expression and bleach   blond wig, are an up close and personal look at the artist, who has   always been rather guarded. &quot;If you want to know Andy Warhol, then   just look at the surface of my pictures, my movies and me and there   I am; there's nothing in between.&quot; - Andy Warhol, cited in Gretchen   Berg, 'Andy: My True Story' in <em>Los Angeles Free Press</em>, 17 March   1967, p. 3</p>
