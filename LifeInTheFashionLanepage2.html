      <p class="style4">By: Ciera Mckissick</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/pullquote2.jpg" alt="pullquote" width="198" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" /><img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/mgprojrun.jpg" alt="mgprojrun" width="302" height="316" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" />Fashion can definitely be theatrical,   which is why Cyr cites Alexander McQueen as one of favorite designers.   This past February she interned with Zac Posen in the design department   while working on her masters. She contributed to the Spring/Summer,   Pre-Fall, and Fall 2009 collections, which were presented at Mercedes-Benz   Fashion Week in New York’s Bryant Park. When asked about her internship   she gushes, “I love Zac.” It was through this internship that Cyr   says she “learned about the magic of fashion.”</p>
        <p class="content">Cyr says she learned to “believe   in herself” from her experience on Project Runway Canada, where she   was a one of the top three finalists to show at L’Oreal Fashion Week   in Toronto. Cyr says that trying out for the show was a joke. “I didn’t   take it that seriously considering it was just a reality TV show,”   she said. But, she always felt that she would make it to the top three   and she did. </p>
        <p class="content">Despite being sent home in the fifth   episode, she was able to fight her way back in the sixth in one of those   wildcard challenges. During the show she coined the phrase <em>MG is   Dead </em>to describe how she felt during her experience.  “Oh God…Reality TV is not serious but yet, we all felt we were going   to die on that stage,” Cyr says. “And, no one besides the contestants   will ever truly understand,” she finishes. </p>
<p class="content">Chicago designer, Anna Hovet, was almost   a contestant on Project Runway. She was chosen to audition as a semi   finalist for the show, but didn’t make the final cut. Hovet, 24 caught   the attention of the people behind the show because of all of the success   she’s been having since she started her own company Anna Hovet Designs   nine months ago. Hovet says she’s learned so much since <img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/anna-working.jpg" alt="anna" width="246" height="328" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />starting her   own business. </p>
        <p class="content">“I had no idea how to run a business   when I started!” Hovet says. “Since I started my company nine months   ago I’ve been asking tons of annoying questions and reading all I   can about fashion business,” she says.</p>
        <p class="content">Before starting Anna Hovet Designs,   Hovet worked with AKIRA as a stylist, where she says she learned a lot   about what it takes to run a business. “I started working at AKIRA   when they were a very new company,” Hovet says.  “I watched and   learned as they grew into a dominating force in Chicago fashion. It   was great working with costumers to learn what women want while also   coordinating and styling fashion shows.”<img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/annawebsite.jpg" alt="annawebsite" width="277" height="312" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="right" /></p>
        <p class="content">Hovet found her way to fashion by posting   photos of her designs on Facebook, where she was able to gain a bit   of exposure. After she had sampled her first full collection, the next   step was to send out press releases, which eventually led to her story   getting picked up and featured in <em>Lucky Magazine</em>. Since then   she has been featured in numerous Chicago blogs and publications, including   the cover of the Chicago Tribune, which she seemed very excited about. </p>
        <p class="content">Hovet moved to Chicago from North Dakota   feeling that Chicago was a good place to start off as a designer given   that there are a lot of “untapped resources in Chicago.” She adds   that “the city is really trying to be recognized as a fashion capital   so there are many programs in motion to help independent fashion designers.”   Which is why she’s not planning on leaving for awhile. She loves Chicago,   and Chicago loves her. She was recently named “Readers’ Choice Best   Clothing Designer” in the <em>Chicago Reader</em> by popular vote, and   she has been chosen as one of six Macy’s Fashion Incubators, which   she will end in Feburary. </p>
        <p class="content"><img src="images/Life in the Fashion Lane/annaclothes.jpg" alt="annaclothes" width="213" height="266" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="2" align="left" />“It is a really wonderful program   for up and coming fashion designers,” Hovet says. “Since May I have   been utilizing the office space, studio, press, and advice from industry   professionals as much as I can.”</p>
        <p class="content">Aside from that program she has just   launched her Fall 2009 and Spring/Summer 2010 line, which she says was   difficult because the production seasons overlapped. She is learning   from her “rookie mistakes” and knows that the future collections   will get “better and better.” Hovet has always been an artist.</p>
        <p class="content"> “I was an artist at an early   age, and as I got older got into music and pop culture, I discovered   fashion,” Hovet says. “Growing up in North Dakota I was always the   “weird girl” who wore pink pants and sequined boots.”</p>
        <p class="content"> She attended the School of the   Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), what she calls a “true art school,”   where she was pushed as an artist to make very complex designs. She   said it definitely paid off. </p>
        <p class="content">Working in the Fashion Industry is   hard work, but if you have a passion for what you do, the job comes   easily, and the work pays off. That doesn’t mean the days get easier   though. Cameron, Cyr and Hovet have all mentioned how crazy their schedules   are. </p>
        <p class="content">“My schedule is different every day,”   Hovet says. “Some days I go from finances, to a photo shoot, to a   client, to a press event, to a fashion show—it’s always crazy. Some   weeks I work 90 hrs, literally sleeping at my studio.”</p>
        <p class="content"> All in a day’s work, when you’re   living life in the fashion lane… </p>
